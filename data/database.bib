Remarque: 
la moyenne géométrique peut être vue comme provenant du problème suivant: pour un rectangle de longueur 'a' et largeur 'b', quel est la longueur de côté 'r' du carré de même aire ? La réponse est donnée en résolvant $r^2=ab$ ce qui n'est autre que $\log r = \frac{1}{2}(\log a+\log b)$. Ainsi, $r$ est obtenu en moyennant, suivant une moyenne arithmétique, les logarithmes.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Knowledge of the probability distribution of initial conditions is central to almost all practical studies of predictability and to improvements in stochastic prediction of the atmosphere. Traditionally, data assimilation for atmospheric predictability or prediction experiments has attempted to find a single ?best? estimate of the initial state. Additional information about the initial condition probability distribution is then obtained primarily through heuristic techniques that attempt to generate representative perturbations around the best estimate. However, a classical theory for generating an estimate of the complete probability distribution of an initial state given a set of observations exists. This nonlinear filtering theory can be applied to unify the data assimilation and ensemble generation problem and to produce superior estimates of the probability distribution of the initial state of the atmosphere (or ocean) on regional or global scales. A Monte Carlo implementation of the fully nonlinear filter has been developed and applied to several low-order models. The method is able to produce assimilations with small ensemble mean errors while also providing random samples of the initial condition probability distribution. The Monte Carlo method can be applied in models that traditionally require the application of initialization techniques without any explicit initialization. Initial application to larger models is promising, but a number of challenges remain before the method can be extended to large realistic forecast models.

  Abstract                 = {Lagrangian data arise from instruments that are carried by the flow in a fluid field. Assimilation of such data into
ocean models presents a challenge due to the potential complexity of Lagrangian trajectories in relatively simple flow
fields. We adopt a Bayesian perspective on this problem and thereby take account of the fully non-linear features of the
underlying model.
In the perfect model scenario, the posterior distribution for the initial state of the system contains all the information
that can be extracted from a given realization of observations and the model dynamics. We work in the smoothing
context in which the posterior on the initial conditions is determined by future observations. This posterior distribution
gives the optimal ensemble to be used in data assimilation. The issue then is sampling this distribution. We develop,
implement, and test sampling methods, based on Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which are particularly well
suited to the low-dimensional, but highly non-linear, nature of Lagrangian data. We compare these methods to the
well-established ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) approach. It is seen that the MCMC based methods correctly sample
the desired posterior distribution whereas the EnKF may fail due to infrequent observations or non-linear structures in
the underlying flow.},

  Abstract                 = {Based on recent work on Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs), this paper presents a simple
and well-founded method to implement the stochastic evolution of a curve. First, we explain why great care should
be taken when considering such an evolution in a Level Set framework. To guarantee the well-posedness of the
evolution and to make it independent of the implicit representation of the initial curve, a Stratonovich differential
has to be introduced. To implement this differential, a standard Ito plus drift approximation is proposed to turn an
implicit scheme into an explicit one. Subsequently, we consider shape optimization techniques, which are a common
framework to address various applications in Computer Vision, like segmentation, tracking, stereo vision etc. The
objective of our approach is to improve these methods through the introduction of stochastic motion principles.
The extension we propose can deal with local minima and with complex cases where the gradient of the objective
function with respect to the shape is impossible to derive exactly. Finally, as an application, we focus on image
segmentation methods, leading to what we call Stochastic Active Contours.},

  Abstract                 = {We discuss a method to solve models with long-range interactions in the microcanonical
and canonical ensemble. The method closely follows the one introduced
by R.S. Ellis, Physica D 133:106 (1999), which uses large deviation techniques.
We show how it can be adapted to obtain the solution of a large class of simple
models, which can show ensemble inequivalence. The model Hamiltonian can
have both discrete (Ising, Potts) and continuous (HMF, Free Electron Laser) state
variables. This latter extension gives access to the comparison with dynamics and
to the study of non-equilibrium effects. We treat both infinite range and slowly
decreasing interactions and, in particular, we present the solution of the Î±--Ising
model in one-dimension with 0<=Î±<1.},

  abstract  = {It has been widely realized that Monte Carlo methods (approxi-
mation via a sample ensemble) may fail in large scale systems. This work offers
some theoretical insight into this phenomenon in the context of the particle
filter. We demonstrate that the maximum of the weights associated with the
sampleensembleconvergestooneasboththesamplesizeandthesystemdi-
mension tends to infinity. Specifically, under fairly weak assumptions, if the
ensemble size grows sub-exponentially in the cube root of the system dimen-
sion, the convergence holds for a single update step in state-space models with
independent and identically distributed kernels. Further, in an important spe-
cial case, more refined arguments show (and our simulations suggest) that the
convergence to unity occurs unless the ensemble grows super-exponentially in
the system dimension. The weight singularity is also established in models with
more general multivariate likelihoods, e.g. Gaussian and Cauchy. Although pre-
sented in the context of atmospheric data assimilation for numerical weather
prediction, our results are generally valid for high-dimensional particle filters},

That is, the inverse estimate of the streamfunction is a weighted least-squares best fit to the initial conditions at t = ?24, to the data at t = ?12 and t = 0, and to the dynamics and the boundary conditions in the interval ?24 Ã¢ÂÂ¤ t Ã¢ÂÂ¤ 0.

The inverse method was tested on ten cases from four different tropical cyclones observed in the South China Sea during the 1990 Tropical Cyclone Motion Program (TCM-90).

The results were quite consistent, with the inverse method providing the smallest mean position error in all ten cases. In addition, all the numerical predictions were compared with a CLIPER (climatology and persistence) scheme.

  Abstract                 = {Long-standing systematic model errors in both tropics and extratropics of the ECMWF model run at
a horizontal resolution typical for climate models are investigated. Based on the hypothesis that the mis-
representation of unresolved scales contributes to the systematic model error, three model refinements aimed
at their representation -- fluctuating or deterministically -- are investigated.
Increasing horizontal resolution to explicitly simulate smaller-scale features, representing subgrid-scale
fluctuations by a stochastic parameterization, and improving the deterministic physics parameterizations all lead
to a decrease in the systematic bias of the Northern Hemispheric circulation. These refinements reduce the
overly zonal flow and improve the modelâs ability to capture the frequency of blocking. However, the model
refinements differ greatly in their impact in the tropics. While improving the deterministic and introducing
stochastic parameterizations reduces the systematic precipitation bias and improves the characteristics of
convectively coupled waves and tropical variability in general, increasing horizontal resolution has little impact.
The fact that different model refinements can lead to reductions in systematic model error is consistent with
the hypothesis that unresolved scales play an important role. At the same time, this degeneracy of the response
to different forcings can lead to compensating model errors. Hence, if one takes the view that stochastic pa-
rameterization should be an important element of next-generation climate models, if only to provide reliable
estimates of model uncertainty, then a fundamental conclusion of this study is that stochasticity should be
incorporated within the design of physical process parameterizations and improvements of the dynamical core
and not added a posteriori.},

  Abstract                 = {Practical applications of kernel methods often use variable bandwidth kernels, also known as self-tuning kernels, however much of the current theory of kernel based techniques is only applicable to fixed bandwidth kernels. In this paper, we derive the asymptotic expansion of these variable bandwidth kernels for arbitrary bandwidth functions; generalizing the theory of Diffusion Maps and Laplacian Eigenmaps. We also derive pointwise error estimates for the corresponding discrete operators which are based on finite data sets; generalizing a result of Singer which was restricted to fixed bandwidth kernels. Our analysis reveals how areas of small sampling density lead to large errors, particularly for fixed bandwidth kernels. We explain the limitation of the existing theory to data sampled from compact manifolds by showing that when the sampling density is not bounded away from zero (which implies that the data lies on an open set) the error estimates for fixed bandwidth kernels will be unbounded. We show that this limitation can be overcome by choosing a bandwidth function inversely proportional to the sampling density (which can be estimated from data) which allows us to control the error estimates uniformly over a non-compact manifold. We numerically verify these results on non-compact manifolds by constructing the generator of the OrnsteinâUhlenbeck process on a real line and a two-dimensional plane using data sampled independently from the respective invariant measures. We also verify our results on compact manifolds by constructing the Laplacian on the unit circle and the unit sphere and we show that the variable bandwidth kernels exhibit reduced sensitivity to bandwidth selection and give better results for an automatic bandwidth selection algorithm.},

  Abstract                 = {Many ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) data assimilation (DA) schemes reduce the effect of spurious ensemble correlations caused by small ensemble size by multiplying the correlations by moderation functions. Moderation functions envelop true error correlation functions. Ideal moderation functions would adapt to variations in the movement and width of true error correlation functions. Here, we describe a new method in which flow-dependent moderation functions are built from powers of smoothed ensemble correlations. The approach imparts to the moderation function movement and width information retained by the smoothed ensemble correlations. Spurious smoothed ensemble correlations are attenuated by raising them to a power. Simple systems were used to compare DA performance using such Smoothed ENsemble COrrelations Raised to a Power (SENCORP) moderation functions against DA performance using optimally tuned but non-adaptive moderation functions. The simple systems considered feature propagating error correlation functions and error correlation functions with variable width. It was found that when significant spatio-temporal variations in the true error correlation function are present, SENCORP moderation functions are superior to non-adaptive moderation functions. In the absence of spatio-temporal variations, the DA performance of SENCORP moderation functions was found to be statistically indistinguishable from the DA performance of non-adaptive moderation functions. An example using a primitive equation global model is given to illustrate how the method could be used to improve the performance of a local ensemble Kalman filter/smoother, particularly when larger observation volumes are used, to better account for error propagation and/or observations that represent vertically averaged variables.},

  Abstract                 = {Previous descriptions of how localized ensemble covariances can be incorporated into variational (VAR)
data assimilation (DA) schemes provide few clues as to how this might be done in an efficient way. This article
serves to remedy this hiatus in the literature by deriving a computationally efficient algorithm for using
nonadaptively localized four-dimensional (4D) or three-dimensional (3D) ensemble covariances in varia-
tional DA. The algorithm provides computational advantages whenever (i) the localization function is
a separable product of a function of the horizontal coordinate and a function of the vertical coordinate, (ii)
and/or the localization length scale is much larger than the model grid spacing, (iii) and/or there are many
variable types associated with each grid point, (iv) and/or 4D ensemble covariances are employed.},

  Abstract                 = {The iterative ensemble Kalman filter (IEnKF) was recently proposed in order to improve the performance of ensemble Kalman filtering with strongly nonlinear geophysical models. The IEnKF can be used as a lag-one smoother and extended to a fixed-lag smoother: the iterative ensemble Kalman smoother (IEnKS). The IEnKS is an ensemble variational method. It does not require the use of the tangent linear of the evolution and observation models, nor the adjoint of these models: the required sensitivities (gradient and Hessian) are obtained from the ensemble. Looking for optimal performance, out of the many possible extensions we consider a quasi-static algorithm. The IEnKS is explored for the Lorenz '95 model and for a two-dimensional turbulence model. As the logical extension of the IEnKF, the IEnKS significantly outperforms standard Kalman filters and smoothers in strongly nonlinear regimes. In mildly nonlinear regimes (typically synoptic-scale meteorology), its filtering performance is marginally but clearly better than the standard ensemble Kalman filter and it keeps improving as the length of the temporal data assimilation window is increased. For long windows, its smoothing performance outranks the standard smoothers very significantly, a result that is believed to stem from the variational but flow-dependent nature of the algorithm. For very long windows, the use of a multiple data assimilation variant of the scheme, where observations are assimilated several times, is advocated. This paves the way for finer reanalysis, freed from the static prior assumption of 4D-Var but also partially freed from the Gaussian assumptions that usually impede standard ensemble Kalman filtering and smoothing.},

  Abstract                 = {The predictability problem for systems with different characteristic timescales is investigated. It is shown that even in simple chaotic dynamical systems, the leading Lyapunov exponent is not sufficient to estimate the predictability time. This fact is due to the saturation of the error on the fast components of the system, which therefore do not contribute to the exponential growth of the uncertainty at large error levels. It is proposed to adopt a generalization of the Lyapunov exponent that is based on the natural concept of error growing time at fixed error size. The predictability time defined in terms of the finite size Lyapunov exponent displays a strong dependence on the error magnitude, as already recognized by other authors.},

  Abstract                 = {COSMO-DE-EPS, a convection-permitting ensemble prediction system based on the high-resolution
numerical weather prediction model COSMO-DE, is pre-operational since December 2010, providing
probabilistic forecasts which cover Germany. This ensemble system comprises 20 members based on
variations of the lateral boundary conditions, the physics parameterizations and the initial conditions. In order
to increase the sample size in a computationally inexpensive way, COSMO-DE-EPS is combined with
alternative ensemble techniques: the neighborhood method and the time-lagged approach. Their impact on
the quality of the resulting probabilistic forecasts is assessed. Objective verification is performed over a six
months period, scores based on the Brier score and its decomposition are shown for June 2011. The
combination of the ensemble system with the alternative approaches improves probabilistic forecasts of
precipitation in particular for high precipitation thresholds. Moreover, combining COSMO-DE-EPS with
only the time-lagged approach improves the skill of area probabilities for precipitation and does not
deteriorate the skill of 2 m-temperature and wind gusts forecasts.},

Our central result is derived from the theory of free random matrices, and gives an explicit expression for the interval where singular values are expected in the absence of any true correlations between the variables under study. Our result can be seen as the natural generalization of the Marcenko-Pastur distribution for the case of rectangular correlation matrices. We illustrate the interest of our method on a set of macroeconomic time series.},

  Abstract                 = {We offer a new computational method to calculate the radiation coefficient Î± of a weakly nonlocal solitary wave in the limit that the amplitude Îµ of the core of the structure tends to zero. (A weakly nonlocal solitary wave is a finite amplitude, nondissipative wave which decays to a sinusoidal oscillation of amplitude Î± at large distance from the core.) The multiple scales series for the solitary wave in powers of Îµ is asymptotic but divergent. When truncated at optimal order (#superasymptotic# approximation), the series gives no information about the radiation coefficient Î± (except order-of-magnitude) because the absolute error is O(Î±). We describe two #hyperasymptotic# approximations which add a second, different asymptotic series to the multiple scales expansion so as to compute Î± itself. The zeroth order hyperasymptotic approximation has a relative error of O(Îµ) in Î±; the sequence of approximations may be extrapolated to give the proportionality constant in the limiting asymptotic expression for Î± as Îµ â 0. The first-order hyperasymptotic approximation has a relative error of only O(Îµ2); its extrapolation gives the O(Îµ) correction to the limit as Îµ â 0.},

  volume    = {131},
  pages     = {2394--2416},
  abstract  = {The spatial resolution appropriate for the simulation of deep moist convection is addressed from a turbulence
perspective. To provide a clear theoretical framework for the problem, techniques for simulating turbulent flows
are reviewed, and the source of the subgrid terms in the NavierâStokes equation is clarified.
For decades, cloud-resolving models have used large-eddy simulation (LES) techniques to parameterize the
subgrid terms. A literature review suggests that the appropriateness of using traditional LES closures for this
purpose has never been established. Furthermore, examination of the assumptions inherent in these closures
suggests that grid spacing on the order of 100 m may be required for the performance of cloud models to be
consistent with their design.
Based on these arguments, numerical simulations of squall lines were conducted with grid spacings between
1 km and 125 m. The results reveal that simulations with 1-km grid spacing do not produce equivalent squall-
line structure and evolution as compared to the higher-resolution simulations. Details of the simulated squall
lines that change as resolution is increased include precipitation amount, system phase speed, cloud depth, static
stability values, the size of thunderstorm cells, and the organizational mode of convective overturning (e.g.,
upright towers versus sloped plumes). It is argued that the ability of the higher-resolution runs to become
turbulent leads directly to the differences in evolution.
There appear to be no systematic trends in specific fields as resolution is increased. For example, mean vertical
velocity and rainwater values increase in magnitude with increasing resolution in some environments, but decrease
with increasing resolution in other environments. The statistical properties of the simulated squall lines are still
not converged between the 250- and 125-m runs. Several possible explanations for the lack of convergence are
offered. Nevertheless, it is clear that simulations with O(1 km) grid spacing should not be used as benchmark
or control solutions for resolution sensitivity studies.
The simulations also support the contention that a minimum grid spacing of O(100 m) is required for traditional
LES closures to perform appropriately for their design. Specifically, only simulations with 250- and 125-m grid
spacing resolve an inertial subrange. In contrast, the 1-km simulations do not even reproduce the correct magnitude
or scale of the spectral kinetic energy maximum. Furthermore, the 1-km simulations contain an unacceptably
large amount of subgrid turbulence kinetic energy, and do not adequately resolve turbulent fluxes of total water.
A guide to resolution requirements for the operational and research communities is proposed. The proposal is
based primarily on the intended use of the model output. Even though simulations with O(1 km) grid spacing
display behavior that is unacceptable for the model design, it is argued that these simulations can still provide
valuable information to operational forecasters. For the research community, O(100 m) grid spacing is recommended
for most applications, because a modeling system that is well founded should be desired for most purposes.},

In particular we show how the Parabolic MongeâAmpére method for constructing a moving mesh in two-dimensions can be coupled successfully to a pressure correction method for the solution of incompressible flows with significant convection and subject to Coriolis forces. This method can be used to resolve evolving small scale features in the flow. In this paper the method is then applied to the computation of the solution to the Eady problem which is observed to develop large gradients in a finite time. The moving mesh method is shown to work and be stable, and to give significantly better resolution of the evolving singularity than a fixed, uniform mesh. },

  Abstract                 = {A stochastic representation of random error associated with parametrized physical processes (âstochastic
physicsâ) is described, and its impact in the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Ensemble
Prediction System (ECMWF EPS) is discussed. Model random errors associated with physical parametrizations
are simulated by multiplying the total parametrized tendencies by a random number sampled from a uniform
distribution between 0.5 and 1.5. A number of diagnostics are described and a choice of parameters is made.
It is shown how the scheme increases the spread of the ensemble, and improves the skill of the probabilistic
prediction of weather parameters such as precipitation. A choice of stochastic parameters is made for operational
implementation. The scheme was implemented successfully in the operational ECMWF EPS on 21 October 1998},

  Abstract                 = {We put forth the idea that Hamiltonâs equations coincide with deterministic and reversible evo-
lution. We explore the idea from five different perspectives (mathematics, measurements, ther-
modynamics, information theory and state mapping) and we show how they in the end coincide.
We concentrate on a single degree of freedom at first, then generalize. We also discuss possible
philosophical reasons why the laws of physics can only describe such processes, even if others must
exist.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, the four-dimensional variational (4D-Var) technique is applied to assimilate aircraft measurements during the Transport and Chemical Evolution over the Pacific (TRACE-P) field experiment into a chemical transport model, Sulfur Transport Eulerian Model, version 2K1 (STEM-2K1). Whether data assimilation would produce better analyzed fields is examined. It is found that assimilating ozone observations from one of two independent flights improves model prediction of the other flight ozone measurements, which are withheld as validation data. The adjusted initial fields after only assimilating the total reactive nitrogen (NOy) observations lead to better predictions of NO, NO2, and PAN, based on their agreement with the withheld measurements. One experiment simultaneously assimilating the observations of O3, NO, NO2, HNO3, PAN, and RNO3 demonstrates that the model is able to match those measurements well by changing the initial fields. In addition, the model predictions of NOy improve significantly after assimilating the aforementioned multiple observation species, which are independent of the withheld NOy measurements. In the paper, we also show that the key species whose initial mixing ratios would significantly affect the agreement between model and measurements can be identified using adjoint sensitivity analysis. Such information can be used to reduce the number of control variables in the 4D-Var data assimilation. To speed up the optimization process in the 4D-Var, we enforce the concentration upper bounds through the limited memory–Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno-B (L-BFGS-B) algorithm, and this proves to be effective.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, the timescale of the convective mass-flux response to step-function changes in external forcing
conditions is measured directly using idealized cloud-resolving model simulations of unorganized convection in
radiative-convective equilibrium. Many parametrization schemes require an estimate of this response time in the
form of a fixed adjustment timescale, but the physical mechanism which sets its value is currently unknown.
These experiments confirm the existence of a unique timescale, for given initial forcing conditions, of the order of
one hour. The hypothesized role of gravity waves in effecting the convective adjustment is tested by changing the
mean cloud spacing of the initial state. This reveals a linear dependence of the response time on the cloud spacing,
in agreement with the theory. Meanwhile, similar experiments to investigate the sensitivity of the timescale
to changes in gravity-wave speed reveal a remarkable robustness of the average wave speed over a range of

  Abstract                 = {We first exhibit in the commutative case the simple algebraic relations between the algebra of functions on a manifold and its infinitesimal length element $ds$. Its unitary representations correspond to Riemannian metrics and Spin structure while $ds$ is the Dirac propagator $ds = \ts \!\!$---$\!\! \ts = D^{-1}$ where $D$ is the Dirac operator. We extend these simple relations to the non commutative case using Tomita's involution $J$. We then write a spectral action, the trace of a function of the length element in Planck units, which when applied to the non commutative geometry of the Standard Model will be shown (in a joint work with Ali Chamseddine) to give the SM Lagrangian coupled to gravity. The internal fluctuations of the non commutative geometry are trivial in the commutative case but yield the full bosonic sector of SM with all correct quantum numbers in the slightly non commutative case. The group of local gauge transformations appears spontaneously as a normal subgroup of the diffeomorphism group.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider the cluster of problems raised by the relation between the notion of time, gravitational theory, quantum theory and thermodynamics; in particular, we address the problem of relating the "timelessness" of the hypothetical fundamental general covariant quantum field theory with the "evidence" of the flow of time. By using the algebraic formulation of quantum theory, we propose a unifying perspective on these problems, based on the hypothesis that in a generally covariant quantum theory the physical time-flow is not a universal property of the mechanical theory, but rather it is determined by the thermodynamical state of the system ("thermal time hypothesis"). We implement this hypothesis by using a key structural property of von Neumann algebras: the Tomita-Takesaki theorem, which allows to derive a time-flow, namely a one-parameter group of automorphisms of the observable algebra, from a generic thermal physical state. We study this time-flow, its classical limit, and we relate it to various characteristic theoretical facts, as the Unruh temperature and the Hawking radiation. We also point out the existence of a state-independent notion of "time", given by the canonical one-parameter subgroup of outer automorphisms provided by the Cocycle Radon-Nikodym theorem.},

The particle trajectories obey SDEs driven by a uniform Wiener process; the inviscid Weber formula for the Euler equations of ideal fluids is used to recover the velocity field. This method admits a self-contained proof of local existence for the nonlinear stochastic system and can be extended to formulate stochastic representations of related hydrodynamic-type equations, including viscous Burgers equations and Lagrangian-averaged Navier-Stokes alpha models.

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Data assimilation is the process of integrating observational data and model predictions to obtain an optimal representation of the state of the atmosphere. As more chemical observations in the troposphere are becoming available, chemical data assimilation is expected to play an essential role in air-quality forecasting, similar to the role it has in numerical weather prediction. Considerable progress has been made recently in the development of variational tools for chemical data assimilation. In this paper we assess the performance of the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) and compare it with a state-of-the-art 4D-Var approach. We analyse different aspects that affect the assimilation process, and investigate several ways to avoid filter divergence. Results with a real model and real observations show that EnKF is a promising approach for chemical data assimilation. The results also point to several issues on which further research is necessary.

  Abstract                 = {A variational approach to the estimation of generators for Markov jump processes from discretely sampled data is discussed and generalized. In this approach, one first calculates the spectrum of the discrete maximum likelihood estimator for the transition matrix consistent with the discrete data. Then the generator that best matches the spectrum is determined by solving a convex quadratic minimization problem with linear constraints (quadratic program). Here, we discuss the method in detail and position it in the context of maximum likelihood inference of generators from discretely sampled data. Furthermore, we show how the approach can be generalized to estimation from data sampled at non-constant time intervals. Finally, we discuss numerical aspects of the algorithm for estimation of processes with high-dimensional state spaces. Numerical examples are presented throughout the paper.},

  abstract  = {The stability properties of intermediate-order climate models are investigated by computing their Lyapunov exponents (LEs). The two models considered are PUMA (Portable University Model of the Atmosphere), a primitive-equation simple general circulation model, and MAOOAM (Modular Arbitrary-Order Ocean-Atmosphere Model), a quasi-geostrophic coupled ocean-atmosphere model on a β-plane. We wish to investigate the effect of the different levels of filtering on the instabilities and dynamics of the atmospheric flows. Moreover, we assess the impact of the oceanic coupling, the dissipation scheme and the resolution on the spectra of LEs.

The PUMA Lyapunov spectrum is computed for two different values of the meridional temperature gradient defining the Newtonian forcing to the temperature field. The increase of the gradient gives rise to a higher baroclinicity and stronger instabilities, corresponding to a larger dimension of the unstable manifold and a larger first LE. The Kaplan-Yorke dimension of the attractor increases as well. The convergence rate of the rate functional for the large deviation law of the finite-time Lyapunov exponents (FTLEs) is fast for all exponents, which can be interpreted as resulting from the absence of a clear-cut atmospheric time-scale separation in such a model.

The MAOOAM spectra show that the dominant atmospheric instability is correctly represented even at low resolutions. However, the dynamics of the central manifold, which is mostly associated to the ocean dynamics, is not fully resolved because of its associated long time scales, even at intermediate orders. As expected, increasing the mechanical atmosphere-ocean coupling coefficient or introducing a turbulent diffusion parametrization reduces the Kaplan-Yorke dimension and Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy. In all considered configurations, it is possible to robustly define large deviations laws describing the statistics of the FTLEs corresponding to the strongly damped modes, while the opposite holds for near-zero LEs and, somewhat unexpectedly, also for the positive LEs.

This paper highlights the need to investigate the natural variability of the atmosphere-ocean coupled dynamics by associating rate of growth and decay of perturbations to the physical modes described using the formalism of the covariant Lyapunov vectors and to consider long integrations in order to disentangle the dynamical processes occurring at all time scales.},

  abstract  = {The maximum-likelihood method for estimating observation and forecast error covariance parameters is described. The method is presented in general terms but with particular emphasis on practical aspects of implementation. Issues such as bias estimation and correction, parameter identifiability, estimation accuracy, and robustness of the method, are discussed in detail. The relationship between the maximum-likelihood method and generalized cross-validation is briefly addressed. The method can be regarded as a generalization of the traditional procedure for estimating covariance parameters from station data. It does not involve anyrestrictions on the covariance models and can be used with data from moving observers, provided the parameters to be estimated are identifiable. Any available a priori information about the observation and forecast error distributions can be incorporated into the estimation procedure. Estimates of parameter accuracy due to sampling error are obtained as a by-product.},

  Abstract                 = {This article proposes a statistical test for whether a multi-model combination with unequal weights has significantly smaller errors than a combination with equal weights. A combination with equal weights includes the case of a no-skill model, in which all weights equal zero, and the multi-model mean, in which all weights equal 1/M, where M is the number of models. The test is applied to seasonal hindcasts of 2 m temperature and precipitation generated by five state-of-the-art coupled atmosphereâocean models. The hypothesis of equal weights could not be rejected over 75% the globe for temperature and 90% of the land for precipitation, implying that strategies for unequal weighting of forecasts may be of value only over a relatively small fraction of the globe. The fact that the test does not require pre-specifying a specific strategy for weighting forecasts suggests that it should be useful for exploring a wide range of multi-model strategies.},

  Abstract                 = {Small amplitude planetary waves are superimposed on a mean zonal flow with arbitrary horizontal and vertical shears. An expression is derived for the change of the zonal wind and temperature field forced by statistically stationary eddies satisfying a source-free planetary wave equation. This result depends on the existence of singular lines, where the phase speed of an elementary wave is equal to the mean zonal wind speed, or on the presence of a Newtonian cooling process. Second-order interactions vanish when both of these phenomena are absent. The planetary wave-zonal flow interaction is discussed in terms of the eddy transport of potential vorticity. The theory provides a partial interpretation of the maintenance of atmospheric zonal flows, such as that of the wintertime stratosphere, by planetary waves propagating from some other region of the atmosphere.},

  Abstract                 = {In this article, we present an overview of methods for sequential simulation from posterior distribu-
tions. These methods are of particular interest in Bayesian filtering for discrete time dynamic models
that are typically nonlinear and non-Gaussian. A general importance sampling framework is devel-
oped that unifies many of the methods which have been proposed over the last few decades in several
different scientific disciplines. Novel extensions to the existing methods are also proposed. We show in
particular how to incorporate local linearisation methods similar to those which have previously been
employed in the deterministic filtering literature; these lead to very effective importance distributions.
Furthermore we describe a method which uses Rao-Blackwellisation in order to take advantage of
the analytic structure present in some important classes of state-space models. In a final section we
develop algorithms for prediction, smoothing and evaluation of the likelihood in dynamic models.},

  Abstract                 = {This article presents the first dynamically adaptive wavelet method for the shallow-
water equations (SWEs) on a staggered hexagonal C-grid. Pressure is located at the
centres of the primal grid (hexagons) and velocity is located at the edges of the
dual grid (triangles). Distinct bi-orthogonal second-generation wavelet transforms
are developed for the pressure and the velocity. These wavelet transforms are based
on second-order accurate interpolation and restriction operators. Together with
compatible restriction operators for the mass flux and Bernoulli function, they
ensure that mass is conserved and that there is no numerical generation of vorticity
when solving the SWEs. Grid refinement relies on appropriate thresholding of
the wavelet coefficients, allowing error control in both the quasi-geostrophic and
inertiaâgravity wave regimes. The SWEs are discretized on the dynamically adapted
multiscale grid using a mass and potential-enstrophy-conserving finite-difference
scheme. The conservation and error control properties of the method are verified
by applying it to a propagating inertiaâgravity wave packet and to rotating shallow-
water turbulence. Significant savings in the number of degrees of freedom are
achieved even in the case of rotating shallow-water turbulence. The numerical
dissipation introduced by the grid adaptation is quantified. The method has been
designed so it can be extended easily to the icosahedral subdivision of the sphere.
This work provides important building blocks for the development of fully adaptive
general circulation models.},

  Abstract                 = {The Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy
(DOAS) method is used extensively to retrieve total column
amounts of trace gases based on UV-visible measurements
of satellite spectrometers, such as ERS-2 GOME. In prac-
tice the sensitivity of the instrument to the tracer density is
strongly height dependent, especially in the troposphere. The
resulting tracer profile dependence may introduce large sys-
tematic errors in the retrieved columns that are difficult to
quantify without proper additional information, as provided
by the averaging kernel (AK). In this paper we discuss the
DOAS retrieval method in the context of the general retrieval
theory as developed by Rodgers. An expression is derived
for the DOAS AK for optically thin absorbers. It is shown
that the comparison with 3D chemistry-transport models and
independent profile measurements, based on averaging ker-
nels, is no longer influenced by errors resulting from a pri-
ori profile assumptions. The availability of averaging ker-
nel information as part of the total column retrieval product
is important for the interpretation of the observations, and
for applications like chemical data assimilation and detailed
satellite validation studies.},

"Comme ceux qui ne comprennent pas la nature des choses sont
incapables de rien affirmer sur elles, mais les imaginent seulement et prennent
l'imagination pour l'entendement, ils croient donc fermement qu'il y a de l'ordre
dans les choses, ignorants qu'ils sont et de la nature des choses et de la leur
propre. Lorsque les choses sont disposées de façon que la représentation par les
sens nous permette de les imaginer facilement, nous disons qu'elles sont bien
ordonnées. Dans le cas contraire nous disons qu'elles sont ou mal ordonnées ou
confuses. Et comme les choses que nous pouvons imaginer facilement nous sont
plus agréables que les autres, les hommes préfèrent donc l'ordre Ã  la confusion,
comme si, en dehors de l'imagination, l'ordre était quelque chose dans la
nature"

  Abstract                 = {We decompose turbulent flows into two orthogonal parts: a coherent, inhomogeneous, non-Gaussian
component and an incoherent, homogeneous, Gaussian component. The two components have
different probability distributions and different correlations, hence different scaling laws. This
separation into coherent vortices and incoherent background flow is done for each flow realization
before averaging the results and calculating the next time step. To perform this decomposition we
have developed a nonlinear scheme based on an objective threshold defined in terms of the wavelet
coefficients of the vorticity. Results illustrate the efficiency of this coherent vortex extraction
algorithm. As an example we show that in a 2562 computation 0.7% of the modes correspond to the
coherent vortices responsible for 99.2% of the energy and 94% of the enstrophy. We also present a
detailed analysis of the nonlinear term, split into coherent and incoherent components, and compare
it with the classical separation, e.g., used for large eddy simulation, into large scale and small scale
components. We then propose a new method, called coherent vortex simulation ÍCVSÍ, designed to
compute and model two-dimensional turbulent flows using the previous wavelet decomposition at
each time step. This method combines both deterministic and statistical approaches: ÍiÍ Since the
coherent vortices are out of statistical equilibrium, they are computed deterministically in a wavelet
basis which is remapped at each time step in order to follow their nonlinear motions. ÍiiÍ Since the
incoherent background flow is homogeneous and in statistical equilibrium, the classical theory of
homogeneous turbulence is valid there and we model statistically the effect of the incoherent
background on the coherent vortices. To illustrate the CVS method we apply it to compute a
two-dimensional turbulent mixing layer.},

  abstract  = {Dimension is perhaps the most basic property of an attractor. In this paper we discuss a variety of different definitions of dimension, compute their values for a typical example, and review previous work on the dimension of chaotic attractors. The relevant definitions of dimension are of two general types, those that depend only on metric properties, and those that depend on the frequency with which a typical trajectory visits different regions of the attractor. Both our example and the previous work that we review support the conclusion that all of the frequency dependent dimensions take on the same value, which we call the "dimension of the natural measure", and all of the metric dimensions take on a common value, which we call the "fractal dimension". Furthermore, the dimension of the natural measure is typically equal to the Lyapunov dimension, which is defined in terms of Lyapunov numbers, and thus is usually far easier to calculate than any other definition. Because it is computable and more physically relevant, we feel that the dimension of the natural measure is more important than the fractal dimension.},

  Abstract                 = {Stochastic backscatter, eddy drain viscosity, and net eddy viscosity parameterizations are formulated and
calculated for two-dimensional turbulence on the sphere based on eddy damped quasi-normal Markovian and
direct interaction approximation closures. The net eddy viscosity is found to be the relatively small difference
between the eddy drain viscosity and the backscatter viscosity. These eddy parameterizations have a cusp behavior
at the cutoff wavenumber where they have their largest magnitudes.
Large-eddy simulations (LES) with the barotropic vorticity equation have been performed incorporating these
dynamic subgrid-scale parameterizations and compared with higher-resolution direct numerical simulations
(DNS), which are regarded as the benchmark or ââtruthââ for comparisons. Good comparisons are found between
kinetic energy spectra for the LES and the DNS at the scales of the LES for both nonrotating two-dimensional

  abstract = {This work studies the effects of sampling variability in Monte Carlo-based methods to estimate very high-dimensional systems. Recent focus in the geosciences has been on representing the atmospheric state using a probability density function, and, for extremely high-dimensional systems, various sample-based Kalman filter techniques have been developed to address the problem of real-time assimilation of system information and observations. As the employed sample sizes are typically several orders of magnitude smaller than the system dimension, such sampling techniques inevitably induce considerable variability into the state estimate, primarily through prior and posterior sample covariance matrices. In this article, we quantify this variability with mean squared error measures for two Monte Carlo-based Kalman filter variants: the ensemble Kalman filter and the ensemble square-root Kalman filter. Expressions of the error measures are derived under weak assumptions and show that sample sizes need to grow proportionally to the square of the system dimension for bounded error growth. To reduce necessary ensemble size requirements and to address rank-deficient sample covariances, covariance-shrinking (tapering) based on the Schur product of the prior sample covariance and a positive definite function is demonstrated to be a simple, computationally feasible, and very effective technique. Rules for obtaining optimal taper functions for both stationary as well as non-stationary covariances are given, and optimal taper lengths are given in terms of the ensemble size and practical range of the forecast covariance. Results are also presented for optimal covariance inflation. The theory is verified and illustrated with extensive simulations.},

well as very complex systems, and reflecting the Hamiltonian nature of
the microscopic motion. In Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics theorems
of comparable generality do not seem to be available. Yet it is possi-
ble to find general, model independent, properties valid even for simple
chaotic systems (i.e. the hyperbolic ones), which acquire special inter-
est for large systems: the Chaotic Hypothesis leads to the Fluctuation
Theorem which provides general properties of certain very large fluctu-
ations and reflects the time-reversal symmetry. Implications on Fluids
and Quantum systems are briefly hinted. The physical meaning of the
Chaotic Hypothesis, of SRB distributions and of the Fluctuation The-
orem is discussed in the context of their interpretation and relevance

It did cause a revision of our views of motion, particularly through Boltzmann and Poincar\'e: we discuss how Boltmann's conception of motion is still very modern and how it can provide ideas and methods to study the problem of nonequilibrium in mechanics and in fluids. This leads to the chaotic hypothesis, a recent interpretation of a very ambitious principle conceived by D. Ruelle: it is a possible extension of the ergodic hypothesis and it implies general parameterless relations. Together with further ideas, it appears to be consistent with some recent experiments as we discuss here.},

flow, a chaotic hypothesis for reversible dissipative many-particle systems in
nonequilibrium stationary states in general. This implies an extension of the
zeroth law of thermodynamics to nonequilibrium states and it leads to the 
identification of a unique distribution $\mu$ describing the asymptotic properties of the
time evolution of the system for initial data randomly chosen with respect to a
uniform distribution on phase space. For conservative systems in thermal equi-
librium the chaotic hypothesis implies the ergodic hypothesis. We outline a
procedure to obtain the distribution $\mu$: it leads to a new unifying point of view
for the phase space behavior of dissipative and conservative systems. The
chaotic hypothesis is confirmed in a nontrivial, parameter-free, way by a recent
computer experiment on the entropy production fluctuations in a shearing fluid
far from equilibrium. Similar applications to other models are proposed, in
particular to a model for the Kolmogorov-Obuchov theory for turbulent flow.},

  Abstract                 = {Ruelleâs principle for turbulence leading to what is usually called the Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen distribution 
(SRB) is applied to the statistical mechanics of many particle systems in nonequilibrium
stationary states. A specific prediction, obtained without the need to construct explicitly the SRB
itself, is shown to be in agreement with a recent computer experiment on a strongly sheared fluid.
This presents the first test of the principle on a many particle system far from equilibrium. A
possible application to fluid mechanics is also discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a family of kernels for analysis of data generated by dynamical systems. These so-called cone kernels feature a dependence on the dynamical vector field operating in the phase space manifold, estimated empirically through finite differences of time-ordered data samples. In particular, cone kernels assign strong affinity to pairs of samples whose relative displacement vector lies within a narrow cone aligned with the dynamical vector field. The outcome of this explicit dependence on the dynamics is that, in a suitable asymptotic limit, Laplace--Beltrami operators for data analysis constructed from cone kernels generate diffusions along the integral curves of the dynamical vector field. This property is independent of the observation modality, and endows these operators with invariance under a weakly restrictive class of transformations of the data (including conformal transformations), while it also enhances their capability to extract intrinsic dynamical timescales via eigenfunctions. Here, we study these features by establishing the Riemannian metric tensor induced by cone kernels in the limit of large data. We find that the corresponding Dirichlet energy is governed by the directional derivative of functions along the dynamical vector field, giving rise to a measure of roughness of functions that favors slowly varying observables. We demonstrate the utility of cone kernels in nonlinear flows on the 2-torus and North Pacific sea surface temperature data generated by a comprehensive climate model.},

  Abstract                 = {Many problems in complex dynamical systems involve metastable regimes despite nearly Gaussian statistics with underlying dynamics that is very different from the more familiar flows of molecular dynamics. There is significant theoretical and applied interest in developing systematic coarse-grained descriptions of the dynamics, as well as assessing their skill for both short- and long-range prediction. Clustering algorithms, combined with finite-state processes for the regime transitions, are a natural way to build such models objectively from data generated by either the true model or an imperfect model. The main theme of this paper is the development of new practical criteria to assess the predictability of regimes and the predictive skill of such coarse-grained approximations through empirical information theory in stationary and periodically-forced environments. These criteria are tested on instructive idealized stochastic models utilizing K -means clustering in conjunction with running-average smoothing of the training and initial data for forecasts. A perspective on these clustering algorithms is explored here with independent interest, where improvement in the information content of finite-state partitions of phase space is a natural outcome of low-pass filtering through running averages. In applications with time-periodic equilibrium statistics, recently developed finite-element, bounded-variation algorithms for nonstationary autoregressive models are shown to substantially improve predictive skill beyond standard autoregressive models. },

  abstract = {A new mesh movement algorithm is presented based on a Legendre transform arising from optimal transportation theory. This naturally allows the mesh connectivity to change, so that adjacent cells can move apart to avoid regions of distorted or poor quality mesh. It is applied here to the Euler equations with conservation on such a mesh achieved by the construction of spaceâtime cells. The method is demonstrated on problems with large deformations and where the regions of concentrated mesh change their topology, e.g. merging and separating. Â© British Crown Copyright 2007/MOD.

  abstract = {An algorithm, the bootstrap filter, is proposed for implementing recursive Bayesian filters. The required density of the state vector is represented as a set of random samples, which are updated and propagated by the algorithm. The method is not restricted by assumptions of linearity or Gaussian noise: it may be applied to any state transition or measurement model. A simulation example of the bearings only tracking problem is presented. This simulation includes schemes for improving the efficiency of the basic algorithm. For this example, the performance of the bootstrap filter is greatly superior to the standard extended Kalman filter},

The cycles arise from the investment-profit instability and are constrained by the increase in labor costs and the inertia of production capacity. For other parameter ranges, the model exhibits chaotic behavior. These results show that complex variability in the economic system may be due to deterministic, intrinsic factors, even if the long-term equilibrium is neo-classical in nature. },

  Abstract                 = {Extreme events are one of the main channels through which climate and socioeconomic systems interact, and it is likely that climate change will modify the probability distribution of the losses they generate. The long-term growth models used in climate change assessments, however, cannot capture the effects of such short-term shocks. To investigate this issue, a non-equilibrium dynamic model (NEDyM) is used to assess the macroeconomic consequences of extreme events. This exercise allowed us to define the economic amplification ratio, as the ratio of the overall production loss due to an event to its direct costs. This ratio could be used to improve the costâbenefit analysis of prevention measures. We found also that, unlike a Solow-like model, \{NEDyM\} exhibits a bifurcation in \{GDP\} losses: for each value of the capacity to fund reconstruction, \{GDP\} losses remain moderate if the intensity and frequency of extremes remain under a threshold value, beyond which \{GDP\} losses increase sharply. This bifurcation may partly explain why some poor countries that experience repeated natural disasters cannot develop. Applied to the specific issue of climate change, this model highlights the importance of short-term constraints in the assessment of long-term damages, and shows that changes in the distribution of extremes may entail significant \{GDP\} losses in absence of specific adaptation. It suggests, therefore, that to avoid inaccurately low assessments of damages, researchers must take into account the distribution of extremes instead of their average cost and make explicit assumptions on the organization of future economies. },

  abstract  = {We study the predictability of chaotic conserva-
tive and dissipative maps in the context of ensemble predic-
tion. Finite-size perturbations around a reference trajectory
are evolved under the full nonlinear system dynamics; this
evolution is characterized by error growth factors and inves-
tigated as a function of prediction time and initial perturba-
tion size. The distribution of perturbation growth is studied.
We then focus on the worst-case predictability, i.e., the max-
imum error growth over all initial conditions. The estimate
of the worst-case predictability obtained from the ensemble
approach is compared to the estimate given by the largest
singular value of the linearized system dynamics. For small
prediction times, the worst-case error growth obtained from
the nonlinear ensemble approach is exponential with predic-
tion time; for large prediction times, a power-law dependence
is observed the scaling exponent of which depends systemat-
ically on the initial error size. The question is addressed of
how large an ensemble is necessary to reliably estimate the
maximum error growth factor. A power-law dependence of
the error in the estimate of the growth factor on the ensemble
size is established empirically. Our results are valid for sev-
eral markedly different chaotic conservative and dissipative
systems, perhaps pointing to quite general features.},

  Abstract                 = {In order to use the information present in past observations and simultaneously to take advantage of the benefits of stochastic dynamic prediction we formulate the lagged average forecast (LAF) method. In a LAF, just as in a Monte Carlo forecast (MCF), sample statistics are calculated from an ensemble of forecasts. Each LAF ensemble member is an ordinary dynamical forecast (ODF) started from the initial conditions observed at a time lagging the start of the forecast period by a different amount. These forecasts are averaged at their proper verification times to obtain an LAF. The LAF method is operationally feasible since the LAF ensemble members are produced during the normal operational cycle.To test the LAF method, we use a two-layer, f-plane, highly truncated spectral model, forced by asymmetric Newtonian heating of the lower layer. In the experiments, a long run is generated by the primitive equation version of the model which is taken to represent nature, while forecasts are made by the quasigeostrophic version of the model. On the basis of forecast skill, the LAF and MCF are superior to the ODF; this occurs principally because ensemble averaging hedges the LAF and MCF toward the climate mean. The LAF, MCF and ODF are all improved when tempered by a simple regression filter; this procedure yields different weights for the different members of the LAF ensemble. The tempered LAF is the most skillful of the forecast methods tested. The LAF and MCF can provide a priori estimates of forecast skill because there is a strong correlation between the dispersion of the ensemble and the loss of predictability. In this way the time at which individual forecasts lose their skill can be predicted.The application of the LAF method to more realistic models and to monthly or seasonally averaged forecasts is briefly discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Forecast error is decomposed into three components, termed displacement error, amplitude error, mid residual error, respectively. Displacement error measures how much of the forecast error can be accounted for by moving the forecast to best fit the analysis. Amplitude error measures how much of the forecast error can be accounted for by changing the amplitude of the displaced forecast to best fit the analysis. The combination of a displacement and an amplification is called a distortion. The part of the forecast error unaccounted for by the distortion is called the residual error. The distortion must be large scale, in line with the basic premise that forecast errors are best described by reference to large-scale meteorological features. A general mathematical formalism for defining distortions and decomposing forecast errors into distortion and residual errors is formulated. The distortion representation of forecast errors should prove useful for describing forecast skill and for representing the statistics of the background errors in objective data analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper investigates an approximation scheme of the optimal nonlinear Bayesian filter based on the Gaussian mixture representation of the state probability distribution function. The resulting filter is similar to the particle filter, but is different from it in that the standard weight-type correction in the particle filter is complemented by the Kalman-type correction with the associated covariance matrices in the Gaussian mixture. The authors show that this filter is an algorithm in between the Kalman filter and the particle filter, and therefore is referred to as the particle Kalman filter (PKF).

In the PKF, the solution of a nonlinear filtering problem is expressed as the weighted average of an âensemble of Kalman filtersâ operating in parallel. Running an ensemble of Kalman filters is, however, computationally prohibitive for realistic atmospheric and oceanic data assimilation problems. For this reason, the authors consider the construction of the PKF through an âensembleâ of ensemble Kalman filters (EnKFs) instead, and call the implementation the particle EnKF (PEnKF). It is shown that different types of the EnKFs can be considered as special cases of the PEnKF. Similar to the situation in the particle filter, the authors also introduce a resampling step to the PEnKF in order to reduce the risk of weights collapse and improve the performance of the filter. Numerical experiments with the strongly nonlinear Lorenz-96 model are presented and discussed.},

  abstract  = {Since 12 January 2005, an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) has been used operationally at the Meteoro-
logical Service of Canada to provide the initial conditions for the medium-range forecasts of the ensemble
prediction system. One issue in EnKF development is how to best account for model error.
It is shown that in a perfect-model environment, without any model error or model error simulation, the
EnKF spread remains representative of the ensemble mean error with respect to a truth integration. Con-
sequently, the EnKF can be used to quantify the impact of the various error sources in a data-assimilation
cycle on the quality of the ensemble mean.
Using real rather than simulated observations, but still not simulating model error in any manner, the rms
ensemble spread is found to be too small by approximately a factor of 2. It is then attempted to account for
model error by using various combinations of the following four different approaches: (i) additive isotropic
model error perturbations; (ii) different versions of the model for different ensemble members; (iii) stochastic
perturbations to physical tendencies; and (iv) stochastic kinetic energy backscatter.
The addition of isotropic model error perturbations is found to have the biggest impact. The identification
of model error sources could lead to a more realistic, likely anisotropic, parameterization. Using different
versions of the model has a small but clearly positive impact and consequently both (i) and (ii) are used in the
operational EnKF. The use of approaches (iii) and (iv) did not lead to further improvements.},

manifolds acted upon by Lie groups. The retention of Lie-group structure
under discretization is often vital in the recovery of qualitatively-correct ge-

introduced requisite elements of differential geometry, this paper surveys the
novel theory of numerical integrators that respect Lie-group structure, high-

  Abstract                 = {In the last decades, the problem of stability of chaotic systems has generated a great deal of interest. In the early period of development, most of classical methods about the stability theory were concerned with deterministic dynamical systems and used the Lyapunov function method. Recently, classical methods have been extended to stochastic systems like flow induced vibrations (suspension bridge, tube bundles) or turbulent fluctuations. The use of stochastic methods lead to improve the knowledge about their stability. Several works have shown that the largest Lyapunov exponent could be used as an indicator of stochastic stability. In this paper, the effect of a random excitation (additive and multiplicative noise) on the stability of some dynamical systems will be analysed in using the Itô calculus. Some new expressions for the largest Lyapunov exponent are given and compared with numerical solutions.},

  Abstract                 = {As part of its contribution to The Observing System Research and Predictability Experiment (THORPEX), the Met Office has developed a global, 15 day multimodel ensemble. The multimodel ensemble combines ensembles from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), Met Office and National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and is calibrated to give further improvements. The ensemble post-processing includes bias correction, model-dependent weights and variance adjustment, all of which are based on linear-filter estimates using past forecast-verification pairs, calculated separately for each grid point and forecast lead time.

Verification shows that the multimodel ensemble gives an improvement in comparison with a calibrated single-model ensemble, particularly for surface temperature. However, the benefits are smaller for mean-sea-level pressure (mslp) and 500 hPa height. This is attributed to the higher degree of forecast-error similarity between the component ensembles for mslp and 500 hPa height than for temperature. The results also show only small improvements from the use of the model-dependent weights and the variance adjustment. This is because the component ensembles have similar levels of skill, and the multimodel ensemble variance is already generally well calibrated.

In conclusion, we demonstrate that the multimodel ensemble does give benefit over a single-model ensemble. However, as expected, the benefits are small if the ensembles are similar to each other and further post-processing gives only relatively small improvements},

When the initial conditions are observed with error, there is information in the past forecasts which could increase the accuracy of the numerical predictions. The techniques of control theory provide an optimal method for combining past forecasts with current observations. This paper demonstrates the method on simulated non-linear time series.},

La propagation du chaos s'entend comme suit d'après Salem and Hauray:
si on considere comme des variables aleatoires la position et la vitesse initiales des particules, quand
le nombre de ces particules tend vers lâinfinie, ces variables aleatoires deviennent âindependantesâ.},

  abstract  = {The influence of flow topology on Lagrangian statistics in fluid turbulence is
investigated. The Weiss criterion provides a tool to split the flow into topologically different
regions: elliptic (vortex dominated), hyperbolic (deformation dominated), and intermediate
(turbulent background ) regions. The flow corresponds to forced two-dimensional Navier-Stokes
turbulence in a double periodic or a circular domain, the latter with no-slip boundary conditions.
A Lagrangian approach is adopted by tracking large ensembles of passively advected tracers.
The pdfs (probability density functions) of the residence time in the topologically different
regions are computed introducing the Lagrangian Weiss field, i.e., the Weiss field computed
along the particlesâ trajectories. In elliptic and hyperbolic regions, the pdfs of the residence
time have self-similar algebraic decaying tails. In contrast, in the intermediate regions the
pdf shows exponentially decaying tails. Furthermore, the conditional pdfs of the Lagrangian
acceleration with respect to the flow topology confirm that both strong elliptic and hyperbolic
regions contribute to the large values of Lagrangian acceleration.},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce a new formulation of the ensemble forecast sensitivity developed by Liu and Kalnay with a small
correction from Li et al. The new formulation, like the original one, is tested on the simple Lorenz 40-variable
model. We find that, except for short-range forecasts, the use of localization in the analysis, necessary in
ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) when the number of ensemble members is much smaller than the modelâs
degrees of freedom, has a negative impact on the accuracy of the sensitivity. This is because the impact of an
observation during the analysis (i.e. the analysis increment associated with the observation) is transported by
the flow during the integration, and this is ignored when the ensemble sensitivity uses a fixed localization. To
address this problem, we introduce two approaches that could be adapted to evolve the localization during the
estimation of forecast sensitivity to the observations. The first one estimates the non-linear evolution of the
initial localization but is computationally expensive. The second one moves the localization with a constant
estimation of the group velocity. Both methods succeed in improving the ensemble estimations for longer
forecasts.
Overall, the adjoint and ensemble forecast impact estimations give similarly accurate results for short-
range forecasts, except that the new formulation gives an estimation of the fraction of observations that
improve the forecast closer to that obtained by data denial (Observing System Experiments). For longer-range
forecasts, they both deteriorate for different reasons. The adjoint sensitivity becomes noisy due to the forecast
non-linearities not captured in the linear tangent model and the adjoint. The ensemble sensitivity becomes less
accurate due to the use of a fixed localization, a problem that could be ameliorated with an evolving adaptive
localization. Advantages of the new formulation include it being simpler than the original formulation and
computationally more efficient and that it can be applied to other EnKF methods in addition to the local
ensemble transform Kalman filter.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a short overview of applications of estimation theory in atmospheric chemistry and discuss some common methods of gridding and mapping of irregular satellite observations of chemical constituents. It is shown that these methods are unable to produce truly synoptic maps of short-lived photochemically active species due to insufficient temporal and spatial density of satellite observations. The only way to overcome this limitation is to supplement observations with prior independent information given, for instance, by atmospheric numerical models and/or climatologies. Objective approaches to combining such prior information with observations are commonly referred to as data assimilation. Mathematical basis of data assimilation known as optimal estimation equations is presented following Lorenc [1986]. Two particular techniques of data assimilation, the variational method and the extended Kalman filter, are briefly described, and their applications to time-dependent numerical photochemical models are discussed. We investigate validity of the linear approximation which is utilized in both methods, present time evolution of the linearization and covariance matrices, and discuss some of their properties. On the basis of ideas of Fisher and Lary [1995] we then employ a trajectory model and a photochemical box model for assimilation and mapping of the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) measurements of chemical species. The assimilation is performed using the variational technique and the extended Kalman filter, and results of both methods are presented and discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Uncertainty quantification in \{CFD\} computations is receiving increased interest, due in large part to the increasing complexity of physical models, and the inherent introduction of random model data. This paper focuses on recent application of {PC} methods for uncertainty representation and propagation in \{CFD\} computations. The fundamental concept on which polynomial chaos (PC) representations are based is to regard uncertainty as generating a new set of dimensions, and the solution as being dependent on these dimensions. A spectral decomposition in terms of orthogonal basis functions is used, the evolution of the basis coefficients providing quantitative estimates of the effect of random model data. A general overview of {PC} applications in \{CFD\} is provided, focusing exclusively on applications involving the unreduced NavierâStokes equations. Included in the present review are an exposition of the mechanics of {PC} decompositions, an illustration of various means of implementing these representations, and a perspective on the applicability of the corresponding techniques to propagate and quantify uncertainty in NavierâStokes computations. },

Dans cet article Kolmogorov démontre que les processus en temps continu, Ã  état continu et continu en temps, vérifient l'équation de Fokker-Planck.

(a) La démonstration se fait d'abord sur l'équation rétrograde de l'équation de Kolmogorov (p94-98).

  Abstract                 = {A method is proposed for determining dynamical and observational noise parameters in state and parameter
identification from time series using Kalman filters. The noise covariances are estimated in a secondary
optimization by maximizing the predictive likelihood of the data. The approach is based on internal consistency;
for the correct noise parameters, the uncertainty projected by the Kalman filter matches the actual predictive
uncertainty. The method is able to disentangle dynamical and observational noise. The algorithm is demonstrated
for the linear, extended, and unscented Kalman filters using an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, the noise-driven
Lorenz system, and van der Pol oscillator as well as a paleoclimatic ice-core record as examples. The approach is
also applicable to the ensemble Kalman filter and can be readily extended to non-Gaussian estimation frameworks
such as Gaussian-sum filters and particle filters.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate the theoretical and numerical computation of rare transitions in simple geophysical turbulent models. We consider the barotropic quasi-geostrophic and two-dimensional Navier?Stokes equations in regimes where bistability between two coexisting large-scale attractors exist. By means of large deviations and instanton theory with the use of an Onsager?Machlup path integral formalism for the transition probability, we show how one can directly compute the most probable transition path between two coexisting attractors analytically in an equilibrium (Langevin) framework and numerically otherwise. We adapt a class of numerical optimization algorithms known as minimum action methods to simple geophysical turbulent models. We show that by numerically minimizing an appropriate action functional in a large deviation limit, one can predict the most likely transition path for a rare transition between two states. By considering examples where theoretical predictions can be made, we show that the minimum action method successfully predicts the most likely transition path. Finally, we discuss the application and extension of such numerical optimization schemes to the computation of rare transitions observed in direct numerical simulations and experiments and to other, more complex, turbulent systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Two general algorithms for solving constrained minimization problems are presented and discussed in the context of analysis and assimilation of meteorological observations. In both algorithms, the original constrained problem is transformed by appropriate modifications into one unconstrained problem, or into a sequence of unconstrained problems. The main advantage of proceeding in this way is that the new unconstrained problems can be solved by classical descent algorithms, thus avoiding the need of directly solving the Euler-Lagrange equations of the original constrained problem. The first algorithm presented in the augmented lagrangian algorithm. It generalizes the more classical penalty and duality algorithms. The second algorithm, inspired from optimal control techniques, is based on an appropriate use of an adjoint dynamical equation, and seems to be particularly well adapted to the assimilation of observations distributed in time. Simple numerical examples show the ability of these algorithms to solve non-linear minimization problems of the type encountered in meteorology. Their possible use in more complex situations is discussed, in particular in terms of their computational cost.DOI: 10.1111/j.1600-0870.1986.tb00459.x},

DeVries (KdV) equation and with a multilayer quasigeostrophic model of the ocean area around South Africa.
It is recalled that Kalman-like filters are not variance minimizing for nonlinear model dynamics and that four-
dimensional variational data assimilation (4DVAR)-like methods relying on perfect model dynamics have dif-
ficulty with providing error estimates. The new method does not have these drawbacks. In fact, it combines
advantages from both methods in that it does provide error estimates while automatically having balanced states
after analysis, without extra computations. It is based on ensemble or Monte Carlo integrations to simulate the
probability density of the model evolution. When observations are available, the so-called importance resampling
algorithm is applied. From Bayesâs theorem it follows that each ensemble member receives a new weight
dependent on its ââdistanceââ to the observations. Because the weights are strongly varying, a resampling of the
ensemble is necessary. This resampling is done such that members with high weights are duplicated according
to their weights, while low-weight members are largely ignored. In passing, it is noted that data assimilation is
not an inverse problem by nature, although it can be formulated that way. Also, it is shown that the posterior
variance can be larger than the prior if the usual Gaussian framework is set aside. However, in the examples
presented here, the entropy of the probability densities is decreasing. The application to the ocean area around
South Africa, governed by strongly nonlinear dynamics, shows that the method is working satisfactorily. The
strong and weak points of the method are discussed and possible improvements are proposed.},

  Abstract                 = {Predictions of the future state of the Earthâs atmosphere suffer from the consequences of chaos: numerical weather forecast models quickly diverge from observations as uncertainty in the initial state is amplified by nonlinearity. One measure of the utility of a forecast is its shadowing time, informally given by the period of time for which the forecast is a reasonable description of reality. The present work uses the Lorenz â96 coupled system, a simplified nonlinear model of atmospheric dynamics, to extend a recently developed technique for lengthening the shadowing time of a dynamical system. Ensemble forecasting is used to make forecasts with and without inflation, a method whereby the ensemble is regularly expanded artificially along dimensions whose uncertainty is contracting. The first goal of this work is to compare model forecasts, with and without inflation, to a true trajectory created by integrating a modified version of the same model. The second goal is to establish whether inflation can increase the maximum shadowing time for a single optimal member of the ensemble. In the second experiment the true trajectory is known a priori, and only the closest ensemble members are retained at each time step, a technique known as stalking. Finally, a targeted inflation is introduced to both techniques to reduce the number of instances in which inflation occurs in directions likely to be incommensurate with the true trajectory. Results varied for inflation, with success dependent upon the experimental design parameters (e.g. size of state space, inflation amount). However, a more targeted inflation successfully reduced the number of forecast degradations without significantly reducing the number of forecast improvements. Utilized appropriately, inflation has the potential to improve predictions of the future state of atmospheric phenomena, as well as other physical systems. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Applying a flow-dependent background error covariance (? matrix) in variational data assimilation has been a topic of interest among researchers in recent years. In this paper, an ensemble-based four-dimensional variational (En4DVAR) algorithm, designed by the authors, is presented that uses a flow-dependent background error covariance matrix constructed by ensemble forecasts and performs 4DVAR optimization to produce a balanced analysis. A great advantage of this En4DVAR design over standard 4DVAR methods is that the tangent linear and adjoint models can be avoided in its formulation and implementation. In addition, it can be easily incorporated into variational data assimilation systems that are already in use at operational centers and among the research community. A one-dimensional shallow water model was used for preliminary tests of the En4DVAR scheme. Compared with standard 4DVAR, the En4DVAR converges well and can produce results that are as good as those with 4DVAR but with far less computation cost in its minimization. In addition, a comparison of the results from En4DVAR with those from other data assimilation schemes [e.g., 3DVAR and ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF)] is made. The results show that the En4DVAR yields an analysis that is comparable to the widely used variational or ensemble data assimilation schemes and can be a promising approach for real-time applications. In addition, experiments were carried out to test the sensitivities of EnKF and En4DVAR, whose background error covariance is estimated from the same ensemble forecasts. The experiments indicated that En4DVAR obtained reasonably sound analysis even with larger observation error, higher observation frequency, and more unbalanced background field.

  abstract  = {The available potential energy of the atmosphere may be defined as the difference between the total potential energy and the minimum total potential energy which could result from any adiabatic redistribution of mass. It vanishes if the density stratification is horizontal and statically stable everywhere, and is positive otherwise. It is measured approximately by a weighted vertical average of the horizontal variance of temperature. In magnitude it is generally about ten times the total kinetic energy, but less than one per cent of the total potential energy.Under adiabatic flow the sum of the available potential energy and the kinetic energy is conserved, but large increases in available potential energy are usually accompanied by increases in kinetic energy, and therefore involve nonadiabatic effects.Available potential energy may be partitioned into zonal and eddy energy by an analysis of variance of the temperature field. The zonal form may be converted into the eddy form by an eddy-transport of sensible heat toward colder latitudes, while each form may be converted into the corresponding form of kinetic energy. The general circulation is characterized by a conversion of zonal available potential energy, which is generated by low-latitude heating and high-latitude cooling, to eddy available potential energy, to eddy kinetic energy, to zonal kinetic energy.},

  Abstract                 = {Inequality indices evaluate the divergence between the income distribution and the hypothetical situation
where all individuals receive the mean income, and are unambiguously reduced by a PigouâDalton pro-
gressive transfer. This paper proposes a new approach to evaluate the divergence between any two income
distributions, where the latter can be a reference distribution for the former. In the case where the reference
distribution is perfectly egalitarian â and uniquely in this case â we assume that any progressive transfer
reduces the divergence, and that the divergence can be additively separated into inequality and efficiency
loss. We characterize the unique class of decomposable divergence measures consistent with these views.
We derive the associated relative and absolute subclasses, and we illustrate the applicability of our results.
This approach extends the generalized entropy studied in inequality measurement.},

  Abstract                 = {The moist-air entropy is defined in Marquet (QJRMS 2011, arXiv:1401.1097) by $\boxed{s = s_{ref} + c_{pd} \: \ln(\theta_{s})}$ in terms of two constant values ($s_{ref}$, $c_{pd}$) and a potential entropy temperature denoted by $\theta_s$. It is shown in Marquet (2011) that a quantity denoted by $({\theta}_{s})_1$ plays the role of a leading order approximation of ${\theta}_{s}$. The aim of this note is to demonstrate in a more rigorous way that $({\theta}_{s})_1$ is indeed the leading order approximation of ${\theta}_{s}$, and to derive a second order approximation which may be used in computations of values, gradients or turbulent fluxes of moist-air entropy. Some impacts of this second order approximation are described in this brief version of a note to be submitted to the QJRMS.},

"In the context of Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of the turbulent boundary layer Mason and Thomson (1992)
demonstrated the positive impact of near-gridscale stochastic momentum forcing scaled with the local kinetic
energy dissipation rate. They reasoned that the viscous drain of energy by the Smagorinsky-Lilly formulation
of eddy viscosity reduces the effectiveness of poorly resolved eddies in transporting momentum to the
surface. In order to match the momentum flux by larger-scale eddies, the explicitly resolved flow must
sustain stronger near-surface mean shear and the simulated flow departs significantly from the observed
logarithmic variation with height. Their stochastic backscatter formulation excites energy at scales close to
the model truncation limit and represents a flow of energy from sub-grid scales to explicitly resolved scales.
In simulations with stochastic backscatter, vertical profiles of horizontally averaged flow more nearly
approximate the textbook log-law." (Extrait de Shutts, 2004, p2, avant dernier paragraphe)


"Mason and Thompson (1992)
found that a model including backscatter improved sim-
ulations of the stable atmospheric boundary layer, but
had negligible impact on simulations of buoyant bound-
ary layers. This suggests that backscatter effects may
not be important in the convective region of squall lines,
which has been the focus of this study." (Extrait, Bryan2003MWR, p2414, left col. First para.)},

  abstract  = {The stability and accuracy of the multiply-upstream, semi-Lagrangian method of integrating the advective equation in two dimensions is examined for four different interpolation schemes; namely, bilinear, biquadratic, bicubic and biquartic. All are shown to be consistent and unconditionally stable for constant advecting velocity. Their respective amplitude and phase errors are discussed. They are then used to integrate the test problem of a cone being advected about the plane at constant angular velocity. The merits of the schemes relative to each other and relative to a well tried Eulerian scheme am examined with particular regard to accuracy and computation time.},

  abstract             = {A Kalman filter requires an exact knowledge of the process noise covariance matrix $Q$
and the measurement noise covariance matrix $R$. Here we consider the case in which 
the true values of $Q$ and $R$ are unknown. The system is assumed to be 
constant, and the random inputs are stationary. First, a correlation test is given which checks whether
a particular Kalman filter is working optimally or not. If the filter is suboptimal, a technique is given 
to obtain asymptotically normal, unbiased, and consistent estimates of $\mathbf{Q}$ and $\mathbf{R}$. 
This technique works only for the case in which the form of $Q$ is known and the number of unknown 
elements in $Q$ is less than $n \times r$ where $n$ is the dimension of the state vector and $r$ is 
the dimension of the measurement vector. For other cases, the optimal steady-state gain $K_op$ is 
obtained directly by an iterative procedure without identifying $Q$. As a corollary, it is shown that 
the steady-state optimal Kalman filter gain $K_{op}$ depends only on $n \times r$ linear functionals of
$Q$. The results are first derived for discrete systems. They are then extended to continuous systems.
A numerical example is given to show the usefulness of the approach.},

  comment   = {Le but de cette réflexion est de mettre en évidence l'équivalence de deux modèles de la gravitation conceptuellement très différents. Il faut entendre le mot équivalence dans le sens restreint d'équivalence prédictive (c'est-Ã -dire toute observation ou expérimentation qui valide l'une, valide l'autre et vice-versa). En fait nous montrerons qu'elles sont équivalentes en un sens a priori un peu plus plus fort : les équations sont localement équivalentes. Nous terminerons évidemment par une conséquence épistémologique connue mais rarement prise en compte : même si une théorie est validée par l'observation et l'expérimentation, cela ne suffit pas pour valider les concepts sous-jacents de cette théorie. Dans l'exemple que nous allons développer, deux théories de la gravitation prédictivement équivalentes, validées avec une précision extraordinaire, reposent sur des définitions antinomiques du concept d'espace-temps. Dans l'une des théories l'"espace-temps" est courbe avec une courbure non triviale, dans l'autre l'"espace-temps" est plat.

"L'équivalence rigoureuse - et assez paradoxale - entre le modèle cosmologique newtonien le plus simple et le modèle de Friedmann avec courbure spatiale est évoquée ..."},

  Abstract                 = {Implicit particle filters for data assimilation generate high-probability samples by representing each particle location as a separate function of a common reference variable. This representation requires that a certain underdetermined equation be solved for each particle and at each time an observation becomes available. We present a new implementation of implicit filters in which we find the solution of the equation via a random map. As examples, we assimilate data for a stochastically driven Lorenz system with sparse observations and for a stochastic KuramotoâSivashinsky equation with observations that are sparse in both space and time.},

show its evolution along history, as well as some of its applications. This survey is limited both in number
of topics dealt with and the extent with which they are treated. Some of them, like minimal submanifolds,
K\"ahler manifolds or Morse Theory are completely omitted. Though in an implicit way, the curvature is
already present in the Fifth Euclidâs Postulate. However it does not emerge explicitly in Mathematics
until the appearance of the theory of curves and surfaces in the euclidean space. Taking basically the
work of Gaussâs as a starting point, Riemann defines the curvature tensor in an abstract and rigorous way.
The introduction of multilinear algebra in the second half of the XIX century allowed a better analytic
formulation and its further development. It is worth stressing its fundamental role in the development of
the Theory of Relativity. Besides, the curvature is present, not only in riemannian manifolds, but also
in many other geometric structures, like homogeneous and symmetric spaces, the theory of connections,
characteristic classes, etc. Having in mind that the physical world cannot be explained in a linear way,
the curvature also arises in the theories of Mathematical Physics. Likewise, it seems interesting to note
its presence in applied sciences, like Estereology.},

  Abstract                 = {The present paper has two aims. One is to survey briefly the state of the art of parameter estimation in meteorology and oceanography in view of applications of 4-D variational data assimilation techniques to inverse parameter estimation problems, which bear promise of serious positive impact on improving model prediction. The other aim is to present crucial aspects of identifiability and stability essential for validating results of optimal parameter estimation and which have not been addressed so far in either the meteorological or the oceanographic literature. As noted by Yeh (1986, Water Resour. Res. 22, 95â108) in the context of ground water flow parameter estimation the inverse or parameter estimation problem is often ill-posed and beset by instability and nonuniqueness, particularly if one seeks parameters distributed in space-time domain. This approach will allow one to assess and rigorously validate results of parameter estimation, i.e. do they indeed represent a real identification of physical model parameters or just compensate model errors? A brief survey of other approaches for solving the problem of optimal parameter estimation in meteorology and oceanography is finally presented. },

  abstract  = {The topic of dissipation by macroscopic flows is approached by considering two of its most representative occurences, namely dissipation by plasma flows in the vanishing collisionality limit and dissipation by fluid flows in the vanishing viscosity limit. It is argued that dissipation can arise either due to the residual effect of a microscopic coupling parameter, or due to purely macroscopic nonlinear mixing effects. The combination of these two phenomena puts the problem out of reach of the most successful statistical methods that have been developed in the context of conservative systems, and also raises fundamental mathematical questions. Moreover, explicit computations that would resolve all scales of such flow are still unfeasible in this context, because of the present limitations in memory size and number of operations. It is thus widely recognized that new ways have to be found to make progress. For that purpose, we explore the applicability of a multiscale wavelet framework. First, the partial differential equations which describe the flow must be recast into a discrete wavelet representation, while preserving consistency with the dissipative mechanisms we have outlined. This step, which we call regularization, is the subject of two chapters in this thesis, concerning the special cases of the one-dimensional Vlasov-Poisson equations on the one hand, and of the two-dimensional incompressible Euler equations on the other hand. The possibilities to develop these schemes for the practical simulation of flows is assessed, and they are compared with other existing regularizations mechanisms. To proceed further, the origin of the residual dissipation must be tracked down and linked to mathematical properties of the solutions. We obtain some elements in this direction by studying the collision of a vorticity dipole with a wall in the vanishing viscosity limit. If the solutions are known behave well mathematically, one can readily move to the next step, which is the definition of macroscopic dissipation in the wavelet representation. This is the case for two-dimensional homogeneous turbulent flows which we subsequently address. Finally, as a perspective for future work, we perform a preliminary wavelet analysis of a three-dimensional turbulent boundary layer flow.},

  Abstract                 = {The dynamical and probabilistic aspects of model error arising from the neglect of unresolved scales and the
concomitant reduction of phase space dimensionality of a reference system are analyzed. A general expression
of the mean quadratic error involving the time correlation function of the excess phase space velocity is derived.
In the short time regime, this expression reduces to the sum of a $t^2$ contribution reflecting the structure of the
invariant distribution of the reference system and of a $t^3$ part bearing the signature of the Lyapunov exponents
of both the reduced and the reference models. The approach is illustrated on two classes of systems involving,
successively, multiple time and space scales. A comparison between the purely deterministic analysis and the
one in which the model system is augmented by error sources assimilated to Gaussian random noises is carried
out. It is shown that such a representation leads to a deterioration of the predictive skill of the model as far as
mean values are concerned, but may enhance its variability properties, bringing them closer to the variability
of the reference system.},

  Abstract                 = {The Voronoi diagram of a point set is a fundamental geo-
metric structure that partitions the space into elementary
regions of influence defining a discrete proximity graph and
dually a well-shaped Delaunay triangulation. In this pa-
per, we investigate a framework for defining and building
the Voronoi diagrams for a broad class of distortion mea-
sures called Bregman divergences, that includes not only
the traditional (squared) Euclidean distance, but also vari-
ous divergence measures based on entropic functions. As a
by-product, Bregman Voronoi diagrams allow one to define
information-theoretic Voronoi diagrams in statistical para-
metric spaces based on the relative entropy of distributions.
We show that for a given Bregman divergence, one can de-
fine several types of Voronoi diagrams related to each other
by convex duality or embedding. Moreover, we can always
compute them indirectly as power diagrams in primal or dual
spaces, or directly after linearization in an extra-dimensional
space as the projection of a Euclidean polytope. Finally, our
paper proposes to generalize Bregman divergences to higher-
order terms, called k-jet Bregman divergences, and touch
upon their Voronoi diagrams.},

  Abstract                 = {We discuss the arbitrary polynomial chaos (aPC), which has been subject of research in a few recent theoretical papers. Like all polynomial chaos expansion techniques, aPC approximates the dependence of simulation model output on model parameters by expansion in an orthogonal polynomial basis. The aPC generalizes chaos expansion techniques towards arbitrary distributions with arbitrary probability measures, which can be either discrete, continuous, or discretized continuous and can be specified either analytically (as probability density/cumulative distribution functions), numerically as histogram or as raw data sets. We show that the aPC at finite expansion order only demands the existence of a finite number of moments and does not require the complete knowledge or even existence of a probability density function. This avoids the necessity to assign parametric probability distributions that are not sufficiently supported by limited available data. Alternatively, it allows modellers to choose freely of technical constraints the shapes of their statistical assumptions. Our key idea is to align the complexity level and order of analysis with the reliability and detail level of statistical information on the input parameters. We provide conditions for existence and clarify the relation of the aPC to statistical moments of model parameters. We test the performance of the aPC with diverse statistical distributions and with raw data. In these exemplary test cases, we illustrate the convergence with increasing expansion order and, for the first time, with increasing reliability level of statistical input information. Our results indicate that the aPC shows an exponential convergence rate and converges faster than classical polynomial chaos expansion techniques.},

  Abstract                 = {Stochastic parametrization provides a methodology for representing model uncertainty in ensemble forecasts, 
and also has the capability of reducing systematic error through the concept of nonlinear noise-induced
rectification. The stochastically perturbed parametrization tendencies scheme and the stochastic backscatter
scheme are described and their impact on medium-range forecast skill is discussed. The impact of these
schemes on ensemble data assimilation and in seasonal forecasting is also considered. In all cases, the 
results are positive. Validation of the form of these stochastic parametrizations can be found by coarse-grain
budgets of high resolution (e.g. cloud-resolving) models; some results are shown. Stochastic parametrization 
has been pioneered at ECMWF over the last decade, and now most operational centres use stochastic
parametrization in their operational ensemble prediction systems - these are briefly discussed. The seamless 
prediction paradigm implies that serious consideration should now be given to the use of stochastic
parametrization in next generation Earth System Models.},

  Abstract                 = {The present work assesses non-Gaussianity and asymmetry within the statistical response of the monthly
winter (DecemberâFebruary) precipitation to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) over the North Atlanticâ
European region (NAE). To evaluate asymmetry, data are split through the median of the NAO
index and side correlations are computed for each regime [negative and positive phases of the NAO
(NAO+ and NAO-, respectively)]. The following statistically significant differences between these correlations
are found: (a) near the central North Atlantic, around 40Â°N, 20Â°W, and southeast of Iceland, with
much stronger correlations in the wet-favorable regime: NAO- in the first location and NAO+ in the
second location; (b) around 42Â°N, 48Â°W in the west North Atlantic; and (c) south of Greenland and in the
west Mediterranean near 36Â°N, where, in both cases, the correlation is only relevant for the dry--favorable
NAO+ regime. Based on the above decomposition, a map of a statistical test of asymmetry, applicable for
every bivariate distribution, is shown.
To evaluate redundancy and non-Gaussianity, the mutual information (MI) is computed from information
theory. Its positive contributions resulting from the linear correlation, a purely Gaussian term, and
non-Gaussianity, which vanishes in pure Gaussian cases, are studied. The MI is estimated through two
methods: 1) the truncated Edgeworth expansion of the bivariate probability density function in terms of
Hermite polynomials and cumulants, and 2) the maximum entropy method. This method is quite general,
while the first one is only applicable for small deviations from Gaussianity. The map of non-Gaussian MI
over the NAE domain reveals some coherent regions, where the nonlinear component of the response of
monthly winter precipitation to the NAO is more important. The MI is evaluated both for the original pair
of variables and for that pair after being subjected to Gaussian anamorphosis in order to prevent the
influence of marginal outliers and keep the applicability of the Edgeworth method.},

  abstract  = {Most of the atmospheric and oceanic data assimilation (DA) schemes rely on the Best Linear Unbiased
Estimator (BLUE), which is sub-optimal if errors of assimilated data are non-Gaussian, thus calling for a
full Bayesian data assimilation. This paper contributes to the study of the non-Gaussianity of errors in the
observational space. Possible sources of non-Gaussianity range from the inherent statistical skewness and
positiveness of some physical observables (e.g. moisture, chemical species), the nonlinearity, both of the
data assimilation models and of the observation operators among others. Deviations from Gaussianity can
be justified from a priori hypotheses or inferred from statistical diagnostics of innovations (observation
minus background), leading to consistency relationships between the error statistics. From samples of
observations and backgrounds as well as their specified error variances, we evaluate some measures of
the innovation non-Gaussianity, such as the skewness, kurtosis and negentropy. Under the assumption
of additive errors and by relating statistical moments from both data errors and innovations, we identify
potential sources of the innovation non-Gaussianity. These sources range from: (1) univariate error non-
Gaussianity, (2), nonlinear correlations between errors, (3) spatio-temporal variability of error variances
(heteroscedasticity) and (4) multiplicative noise. Observational and background errors are often assumed
independent. This leads to variance-dependent bounds for the skewness and the kurtosis of errors. From
innovation statistics, we assess the potential DA impact of some scenarios of non-Gaussian errors. This
impact is measured through the mean square difference between the BLUE and the Minimum Variance
Unbiased Estimator (MVUE), obtained with univariate observations and background estimates. In order
to accomplish this, we compute maximum entropy probability density functions (pdfs) of the errors,
constrained by the first four order moments. These pdfs are then used to compute the Bayesian posterior
pdf and the MVUE. The referred impact is studied for a large range of statistical moments, being higher for
skewed innovations and growing in average with the skewness of data errors, specially if the skewnesses
have the same sign. An application has been performed to the quality-accepted ECMWF innovations of
brightness temperatures of a set of High Resolution Infrared Sounder (HIRS) channels. In this context, the
MVUE has led in some extreme cases to a potential reduction of 20%60% of the posterior error variance
as compared to the BLUE, specially for extreme values of the innovations.},

  Abstract                 = {A stochastic parameterization scheme for deep convection is described, suitable for use in both climate
and NWP models. Theoretical arguments and the results of cloud-resolving models are discussed in order
to motivate the form of the scheme. In the deterministic limit, it tends to a spectrum of entraining/detraining
plumes and is similar to other current parameterizations. The stochastic variability describes the local
fluctuations about a large-scale equilibrium state. Plumes are drawn at random from a 
probability distribution function (PDF) that defines the chance of finding a plume of given cloud-base mass flux within each
model grid box. The normalization of the PDF is given by the ensemble-mean mass flux, and this is
computed with a CAPE closure method. The characteristics of each plume produced are determined using
an adaptation of the plume model from the KainâFritsch parameterization. Initial tests in the single-column
version of the Unified Model verify that the scheme is effective in producing the desired distributions of
convective variability without adversely affecting the mean state.},

-----------------------------------------

À un **état macroscopique** est associé un très grand nombre d' **états microscopiques** .
Quand on parle d'état macroscopique on se réfère en fait Ã  un nombre extrêmement
grand d'états microscopique. 

Cette collection d'état défini un ** ensemble statistique ** == ens. de Gibbs.

On peut étudier un système unique et suivre son évolution par l'évolution au cours du temps de son point
représentatif dans l'espace des phases. L'approche alternative proposée par Gibbs est de construire
un nombre extrêmement grand de copies du système ayant un même état macroscopique, et d'étudier 
cet ensemble Ã  un instant donné.

to estimate the fixed parameters and unobserved states of a system model can be
formulated as the evaluation of a discrete
-time path integral in model state space.
The observations serve as a guiding âpoten
tialâ working with the dynamical rules of
the model to direct system orbits in state space. The path-integral representation
permits direct numerical evaluation of the conditional mean path through the state
space as well as conditional moments about this mean. Using a Monte Carlo method
for selecting paths through state space, we show how these moments can be evaluated
and demonstrate in an interesting model system the explicit influence of the role
of transfer of information from the observations. We address the question of how
many observations are required to estimat
e the unobserved state variables, and we
examine the assumptions of Gaussianity of the underlying conditional probability},

Ce qui justifie l'inflation est que la moyenne spatiale de la variance du jour est sationnaire. Ainsi il apparaît cohérent de la modifier pour qu'elle colle Ã  une moyenne spatiale climatologique de référence. La stationnarité est un point important, elle est montré en Fig. 6 de l'article Raynaud (2009). La calibration pour l'erreur modèle fonctionne de la manière suivante:

(1) On calcule une variance climatologique Ã  partir des ensembles,
(2) On calibre cette variance Ã  l'aide d'une inflation déduite de la méthode du Chi 2 (Desroziers et al., 2005),
(3) Pour une date donnée, comme la moyenne spatiale de la variance de l'ensemble du jour est stationnaire, on réalise une
inflation pour que cette valeur moyenne coincide avec la valeur calibrée en (2). Cette inflation incorpore l'ensemble des processus non pris en compte dans la génération de l'ensemble du jour (erreur modèle,..)

  Abstract                 = {Ensemble prediction systems at the convective scale are often under-dispersive. In order to alleviate this problem, a time-lagged ensemble can be created from ensemble forecasts initialized at different production times. While an equal-weight combination of lagged forecasts generally provides competitive results, this article introduces and discusses the efficiency of an objective weighting. The proposed approach is based on nonlinear Bayesian filtering, and the weights are determined online for each member according to the observation likelihood.The method is illustrated with short-range ensemble forecasts provided by the cloud-resolving AROME-France model. A time-lagged ensemble is then constructed from the current ensemble forecasts combined with older ensemble forecasts started 6 and 12 h earlier. It is first shown that the weighting scheme provides reasonable results, in particular it is able to detect differences in forecast quality due to different production times.The question whether these unequal flow-dependent weights can be successfully applied to the members of the time-lagged ensemble is then examined. Results indicate that the weighting does not lead to a noticeable gain in forecast quality. Possible reasons for this limited impact are discussed.},

  abstract  = {Described here is a path integral, sampling-based approach for data assimilation, of sequential data and evolutionary models. 
Since it makes no assumptions on linearity in the dynamics, or on Gaussianity in the statistics, it permits consideration of very general estimation problems. The method can be used for such tasks as computing a smoother solution, parameter estimation, and data/model
initialization.
Speedup in the Monte Carlo sampling process is essential if the path integral method has any chance of being a viable estimator on moderately large problems. Here a variety of strategies are proposed and compared for their relative ability to improve the sampling 
efficiency of the resulting estimator. Provided as well are details useful for its implementation and testing.
The method is applied to a problem in which standard methods are known to fail, an idealized flow/drifter problem, which has been used as
a testbed for assimilation strategies involving Lagrangian data. It is in this kind of context that the method may prove to be a useful assimilation tool in oceanic studies.},

I give tentative definitions of equilibrium state, mean values, mean geometry, entropy and temperature, which reduce to the conventional ones in the non-relativistic limit, but remain valid for a general covariant theory. The formalism extends to quantum theory. The construction builds on the idea of thermal time, on a notion of locality for this time, and on the distinction between global and local temperature. The last is the temperature measured by a local thermometer, and is given by kT = hbar d tau/ds, with k the Boltzmann constant, hbar the Planck constant, ds proper time and d tau the equilibrium thermal time.},

  Abstract                 = {Nonequilibrium statistical mechanics has lagged behind equilibrium statistical mechanics in the acquisition of a solid quantitative theoretical framework. Rapid progress is however taking place now, making use of the chaotic nature of microscopic dynamics. A new idealization of nonequilibrium systems has been introduced, which describes natural steady states by SRB measures. This leads to testable predictions, which we shall discuss.},

  Abstract                 = {We develop a simplified computational singular perturbation (CSP) analysis of a stochastic dynamical system. We focus on the case of parametric uncertainty, and rely on polynomial chaos (PC) representations to quantify its impact. We restrict our attention to a system that exhibits distinct timescales, and that tends to a deterministic steady state irrespective of the random inputs. A detailed analysis of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the stochastic system Jacobian is conducted, which provides a relationship between the {PC} representation of the stochastic Jacobian and the Jacobian of the Galerkin form of the stochastic system. The analysis is then used to guide the application of a simplified {CSP} formalism that is based on relating the slow and fast manifolds of the uncertain system to those of a nominal deterministic system. Two approaches are specifically developed with the resulting simplified {CSP} framework. The first uses the stochastic eigenvectors of the uncertain system as {CSP} vectors, whereas the second uses the eigenvectors of the nominal system as {CSP} vectors. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the results of the stochastic eigenvalue and eigenvector analysis, and illustrate the effectiveness of the simplified {CSP} algorithms in addressing the stiffness of the system dynamics.},

  Abstract                 = {An adaptive wavelet method for solving the two-dimensional NavierâStokes equations is com-
pared with nonlinear Fourier filtering and nonlinear wavelet filtering of the pseudospectral method at each
time step. The methods are each applied to a highly nonlinear flow typical of two-dimensional turbulence, the
merger of two positive vortices pushed together by a weaker negative vortex, and the results are compared
with a reference classical pseudospectral method. Nonlinear Fourier filtering uses 1.7 times fewer active
modes than the reference simulation at the time of merger (when the flow is most complicated) and retains
the overall dynamics and structure of the flow. However, it induces spurious oscillations in the background.
Nonlinear wavelet filtering simulation uses 9.2 times fewer modes than the reference simulation at the time
of merger, and reduces the errors in the solution. The adaptive wavelet simulation replicates precisely the
dynamics and spatial structure of the reference simulation while retaining the high compression rate of
the nonlinear wavelet filtering simulation. In addition we observe that the number of active wavelet modes
remains quasi-constant during the whole merging process, independent of the strength of the vorticity gra-
dients. On the contrary, the number of active Fourier modes is multiplied by 5 when the vorticity gradients
are strongest. The increased accuracy of the adaptive wavelet simulation is due to the security zone added
around the active coefficients and to the compression of the nonlinear term of the NavierâStokes equations in
the wavelet basis. These results suggest that nonlinear Fourier filtering of a classical pseudospectral method
cannot produce significant improvement, but that the adaptive wavelet method combines a consistently high
compression rate with high accuracy.},

  Abstract                 = {A form of kinetic energy backscatter (CASBS) has been tested in the ECMWF ensemble prediction system and shown to
be an effective means of increasing forecast member spread. Better matching of model error growth to ensemble spread
leads to improved probability skill scores and there is preliminary evidence that CASBS can provide this. Some physical
justification for the use of kinetic energy backscatter in NWP models will be discussed here along with a strategy for
quantifying its effect. As an example of this, the use of explicit cloud simulation in big domains to quantify the statistical
effect of deep tropical convection will be discussed and the backscatter forcing function computed by coarse-graining
model fields and determining effective Reynoldâs stresses.},

  Abstract                 = {Stochastic kinetic energy backscatter parameterization schemes are now widely used in ensemble pre-
diction systems to account for random error associated with excessive dissipation and unrepresented energy
backscatter in numerical weather prediction models. This dissipation arises from numerical advection
schemes and explicit diffusion terms and is also implicit in some parameterization schemes. In the absence of
a backscatter theory applicable to the convective scale and mesoscale, current parameterization methods are
based on simple heuristic models designed to scale the energy input in proportion to a suitable measure of net
energy dissipation rate. Free parameters in the formulation of backscatter tend to be tuned for the optimal
performance of ensemble prediction systems, yet other forms of uncertainty represented in these forecasting
systems make that task harder. Results are presented here from a study that aims to characterize the form and
magnitude of kinetic energy backscatter within a global spectral framework. This is achieved by comparing
a high-resolution ââtruthââ model with a spectrally truncated version of the model for which the effect of the
missing scales of motion is to be gauged. Energy exchange between these omitted scales and the resolved
scales of the truncated representation is computed for the dominant terms in the vorticity equation. It is found
that although there is a nonlocal spectral energy flux to low wavenumbers due to the purely rotational part of
the flow, it is much smaller than the dissipative effect associated with terms involving the divergent part of the
flow. Biharmonic horizontal diffusion is found to contribute significantly as an energy sink across the entire
wavenumber spectrum.},

  Abstract                 = {Physical justification is provided for the use of kinetic energy backscatter in forecast models, particularly
in respect of ensemble prediction systems. The rate of energy backscatter to scales near the truncation limit is
controlled by a total energy dissipation function involving contributions from numerical diffusion, mountain drag
and deep convection. A cellular automaton is used to generate evolving patterns that, together with the dissipation
function, define a stream-function forcing field. Each member of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
Forecasts (ECMWF) ensemble forecast system is perturbed by a different realization of this backscatter forcing,
and the resulting increase in ensemble spread, if not excessive, has a beneficial impact on probabilistic measures
of forecast skill. The input of small-scale kinetic energy by the backscatter algorithm also helps to correct a known
problem with the energy spectrum in the ECMWF modelâthe absence of the observed â5/3 spectral slope in
the mesoscales.},

  Abstract                 = {Particle filters are ensemble-based assimilation schemes that, unlike the ensemble Kalman filter, employ
a fully nonlinear and non-Gaussian analysis step to compute the probability distribution function (pdf) of
a systemâs state conditioned on a set of observations. Evidence is provided that the ensemble size required
for a successful particle filter scales exponentially with the problem size. For the simple example in which
each component of the state vector is independent, Gaussian, and of unit variance and the observations are
of each state component separately with independent, Gaussian errors, simulations indicate that the re-
quired ensemble size scales exponentially with the state dimension. In this example, the particle filter
requires at least 1011 members when applied to a 200-dimensional state. Asymptotic results, following the
work of Bengtsson, Bickel, and collaborators, are provided for two cases: one in which each prior state
component is independent and identically distributed, and one in which both the prior pdf and the obser-
vation errors are Gaussian. The asymptotic theory reveals that, in both cases, the required ensemble size
scales exponentially with the variance of the observation log likelihood rather than with the state dimension
per se.},

  Abstract                 = {An improved stochastic kinetic energy backscatter scheme, version 2 (SKEB2) has been developed for the
Met Office Global and Regional Ensemble Prediction System (MOGREPS). Wind increments at each model
time step are derived from a streamfunction forcing pattern that is modulated by a locally diagnosed field of
likely energy loss due to numerical smoothing and unrepresented convective sources of kinetic energy near
the grid scale. The scheme has a positive impact on the root-mean-square error of the ensemble mean and
spread of the ensemble. An improved growth rate of spread results in a better match with ensemble-mean
forecast error at all forecast lead times, with a corresponding improvement in probabilistic forecast skill from
a more realistic representation of model error. Other examples of positive impact include improved forecast
blocking frequency and reduced forecast jumpiness. The paper describes the formulation of the SKEB2 and
its assessment in various experiments.},

fundamental dualities between free energy and relative entropy.
We discuss the applications of the relationship between free
energy and relative entropy to nonlinear stochastic dynamical
systems affine in noise and nonlinear stochastic dynamics affine
in control and noise. For this last class of systems, we provide
the PI optimal control and its iterative formulation. In addition,
we present the connection of PI control derived based on
Dynamic Programming with the information theoretic dualities.
Finally, we provide links to KL stochastic optimal control and
discuss generalizations and future work.},

The covariance is made explicit by working in arbitrary time-dependent coordinates, instead of restricting to Eulerian or Lagrangian coordinates.

required for the deterministic quasi-steady-state approximation. We also show that the large molecule number

  Abstract                 = {The MaddenâJulian oscillation (MJO) is the dominant mode of variability in the tropical atmosphere on intraseasonal time scales and planetary spatial scales. Despite the primary importance of the MJO and the decades of research progress since its original discovery, a generally accepted theory for its essential mechanisms has remained elusive. In recent work by two of the authors, a minimal dynamical model has been proposed that recovers robustly the most fundamental MJO features of (i) a slow eastward speed of roughly 5 m sâ1, (ii) a peculiar dispersion relation with dÏ/dk â 0, and (iii) a horizontal quadrupole vortex structure. This model, the skeleton model, depicts the MJO as a neutrally stable atmospheric wave that involves a simple multiscale interaction between planetary dry dynamics, planetary lower-tropospheric moisture, and the planetary envelope of synoptic-scale activity. In this article, it is shown that the skeleton model can further account for (iv) the intermittent generation of MJO events and (v) the organization of MJO events into wave trains with growth and demise, as seen in nature. The goal is achieved by developing a simple stochastic parameterization for the unresolved details of synoptic-scale activity, which is coupled to otherwise deterministic processes in the skeleton model. In particular, the intermittent initiation, propagation, and shut down of MJO wave trains in the skeleton model occur through these stochastic effects. This includes examples with a background warm pool where some initial MJO-like disturbances propagate through the western region but stall at the peak of background convection/heating corresponding to the Maritime Continent in nature.},

  abstract  = {The theory of large deviations is concerned with the exponential decay of probabilities
of large fluctuations in random systems. These probabilities are important in many
fields of study, including statistics, finance, and engineering, as they often yield valuable
information about the large fluctuations of a random system around its most probable
state or trajectory. In the context of equilibrium statistical mechanics, the theory of large
deviations provides exponential-order estimates of probabilities that refine and generalize
Einsteinâs theory of fluctuations. This review explores this and other connections between
large deviation theory and statistical mechanics, in an effort to show that the mathematical
language of statistical mechanics is the language of large deviation theory. The first
part of the review presents the basics of large deviation theory, and works out many
of its classical applications related to sums of random variables and Markov processes.
The second part goes through many problems and results of statistical mechanics, and
shows how these can be formulated and derived within the context of large deviation
theory. The problems and results treated cover a wide range of physical systems, including
equilibrium many-particle systems, noise-perturbed dynamics, nonequilibrium systems,
as well as multifractals, disordered systems, and chaotic systems. This review also covers
many fundamental aspects of statistical mechanics, such as the derivation of variational
principles characterizing equilibrium and nonequilibrium states, the breaking of the
Legendre transform for nonconcave entropies, and the characterization of nonequilibrium
fluctuations through fluctuation relations.},

Defining the initial data error as the data error source and the model error as the modelling source, we propose the use of the modeling error as a baseline against which potential reductions in data error may be calibrated. In the reverse sense, the data error can also be used to calibrate the reduction in the modeling error. A simple nonlinear model is used to illustrate examples of the above reliability test. Further applications of this test to actual numerical forecast experiments using analyses from both the augmented FWE database and the operational NMC data base are shown. Forecast comparisons using various suites of physical parameterizations are also presented.},

  Abstract                 = {Balanced equations of motion based on potential vorticity evolution and inversion for the shallow water and stratified primitive equations are derived and, in some shallow-water cases, numerically tested. The schemes are based on asymptotic expansions in Rossby or Froude number, or rational scaling-based truncations of the equations of motion, assuming that the dynamics are determined by the advection of potential vorticity. Thus, regimes of validity are rapidly rotating and/or highly stratified flow. Both new and familiar results are straightforwardly obtained, in a unified framework in both height and isentropic coordinates. For both shallow-water and stratified equations, Rossby number expansions schemes give quasi-geostrophy at lowest order. Both gradient-wind balance and the nonlinear terms in the potential vorticity enter at next order. A low Froude number expansion for non-rotating flow gives two-dimensional flow, uncoupled in the vertical at lowest order. A single consistent inversion scheme can be derived that is valid at lowest order in Froude number for all Rossby numbers, for both shallow-water and the stratified equations. It may be a particularly appropriate model for the atmospheric mesoscale and oceanic submesoscale, where rotation and stratification can both be important in defining balanced motion. A model is also proposed that is valid at both planetary and synoptic scales, combining the familiar planetary geostrophic and quasi-geostrophic equations. Most of the models derived require the solution only of linear or near linear elliptic equations, possibly with varying coefficients.Numerical experiments indicate that a higher-order inversion can be quantitatively better than quasigeostrophy, if Rossby number and divergence are sufficiently small. In some other cases, no noticeable improvement over quasi-geostrophy is found, even when the Rossby number is quite small. However, the balanced model valid for both planetary and synoptic scales shows a significant qualitative and quantitative improvement over both planetary geostrophy and quasi-geostrophy for large-scale flows, and its evolution is in good agreement with a primitive equation model.},

 ** Pourquoi ** les processus stochastique en physique ?
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"What is true is that experience has taught us that in spite of our ignorance of most of the microscopique variables it is still possible to detect regularities in the macroscopic behavior and formulate them in general laws" 
"It thus appeas that the precise values of those microscopic variable are not important and therefore one might as well average over them."
"This is a property of the system not of the observer"
(p57, Â§2)

 ** Comment ** les processus stochastique entrent-ils en physique ?
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"The basic idea of statistical mechanics is that the system may be replaced with a suitable chosen ensemble of systems, all having the same equations of motion but different initial microstates. [ The structure of the ensemble is specified by a density function that feature the 
number of sample systems whose initial microstate lies in a given volume element. ]"


p58.: Une particule loudre dans un gas de molécule mono-atomique, Y(t) désigne la position de la particule lourde. La théorie du mouvement Brownien montre que la vitesse moyenne obéie Ã  la loi de dissipation macroscopique, tandis que la fonction d'auto-corrélation détermine le coefficient de diffusion.
p58.: "The basic idea of statistical mechanics is that, for a stationnary process, one may use the ensemble average in lieu of the time average, which is directly connected with observations."

p59: "The drastic nature of the repeated randomness assumption is manifest as the resulting macroscopic and mesoscopique equations are irreversible, while the underlying microscopic equations are reversible in time. [...] Clearly, something else is needed than pure mathmatics to understand why Nature confronts us only with processes in which entropy increases, although the reversed processes are equally consistent with the microscopic equations of motion. This is the fundamental problem in justifying the statistical mechanics of irreversible processes."},

  abstract  = {The natural instability of the atmosphere is at the origin of the rapid amplification of errors coming from the
uncertainty on the initial conditions and from the imperfect representation (the model) of the atmospheric
dynamics. In this paper, the short-term dynamics of model error is examined in the context of low-order chaotic
dynamical systems. A mathematical model describing the dynamics of this error is first derived where some of
the key ingredients of its erratic behavior are incorporated, namely, the variability of the local Lyapunov exponents
and of the model error source term along the dominant unstable direction. The analysis of this simplified equation
indicates that depending on the nature of the model error sources (here limited to a white noise or an Ornsteinâ
Uhlenbeck process), the mean square error initially follows either a linear or a quadratic evolution, the latter
being generic.
The numerical analysis of the Lorenz 1984 low-order atmospheric system, in which the model error source
is associated with the inaccurate estimate of one of its parameters, supports the main features demonstrated by
the simplified mathematical model. However, it also reveals a more involved behavior of the mean square error,
which can be traced back to some intrinsic properties of the underlying dynamics not incorporated in the simplified
model.
The role of the truncation of the small scales of the flow on the dynamics of the larger scales is also studied
in two spatially distributed systems. In this context, the mean square error closely follows a quadratic evolution
for short times. In the light of these results, the classical view of the linear evolution of the mean square error
advanced thus far in the literature should be reassessed.},

Gravity is identified with an entropic force caused by changes in the information associated with the positions of material bodies. A relativistic generalization of the presented arguments directly leads to the Einstein equations. When space is emergent even Newton's law of inertia needs to be explained. The equivalence principle auggests that it is actually the law of inertia whose origin is entropic.},

  Abstract                 = {This talk presents applications of concentration of measure phenomena in the emerging ï¬eld of
Compressive Sensing (CS). CS builds on the premise that a signal having a sparse representation in some
basis can be recovered from a small number of linear measurements of that signal. Many of the most
effective constructions for the linear measurement operator involve random matrices, and at the heart of
much analysis in CS is a precise statistical characterization of the product of a random matrix with a sparse
signal. Building on a simple concentration of measure inequality, for example, it is possible to generalize
the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma and ensure an approximate distance-preserving embedding for an entire
family of sparse signals. This âRestricted Isometry Propertyâ for the measurement operator has been shown
in CS to permit stable recovery of sparse signals from small numbers of measurements. We will also discuss
a related problems in Compressive Signal Processing (CSP), in which the goal is not to recover (high-
complexity question) a sparse signal (low-dimensional model) but rather to answer low-complexity questions
about arbitrary high-dimensional signals. We will discuss how concentration of measure inequalities can be
used to give performance guarantees for problems such as compressive detection and estimation.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract An equation of MongeâAmpère type has, for the first time, been solved numerically on the surface of the sphere in order to generate optimally transported (OT) meshes, equidistributed with respect to a monitor function. Optimal transport generates meshes that keep the same connectivity as the original mesh, making them suitable for r-adaptive simulations, in which the equations of motion can be solved in a moving frame of reference in order to avoid mapping the solution between old and new meshes and to avoid load balancing problems on parallel computers. The semi-implicit solution of the MongeâAmpère type equation involves a new linearisation of the Hessian term, and exponential maps are used to map from old to new meshes on the sphere. The determinant of the Hessian is evaluated as the change in volume between old and new mesh cells, rather than using numerical approximations to the gradients. \{OT\} meshes are generated to compare with centroidal Voronoi tessellations on the sphere and are found to have advantages and disadvantages; \{OT\} equidistribution is more accurate, the number of iterations to convergence is independent of the mesh size, face skewness is reduced and the connectivity does not change. However anisotropy is higher and the \{OT\} meshes are non-orthogonal. It is shown that optimal transport on the sphere leads to meshes that do not tangle. However, tangling can be introduced by numerical errors in calculating the gradient of the mesh potential. Methods for alleviating this problem are explored. Finally, \{OT\} meshes are generated using observed precipitation as a monitor function, in order to demonstrate the potential power of the technique. },

  Abstract                 = {We consider two weakly coupled systems and adopt a perturbative approach based on the Ruelle response theory to study their interaction. We propose a systematic way of parameterizing the effect of the coupling as a function of only the variables of a system of interest. Our focus is on describing the impacts of the coupling on the long term statistics rather than on the finite-time behavior. By direct calculation, we find that, at first order, the coupling can be surrogated by adding a deterministic perturbation to the autonomous dynamics of the system of interest. At second order, there are additionally two separate and very different contributions. One is a term taking into account the second-order contributions of the fluctuations in the coupling, which can be parameterized as a stochastic forcing with given spectral properties. The other one is a memory term, coupling the system of interest to its previous history, through the correlations of the second system. If these correlations are known, this effect can be implemented as a perturbation with memory on the single system. In order to treat this case, we present an extension to Ruelle's response theory able to deal with integral operators. We discuss our results in the context of other methods previously proposed for disentangling the dynamics of two coupled systems. We emphasize that our results do not rely on assuming a time scale separation, and, if such a separation exists, can be used equally well to study the statistics of the slow variables and that of the fast variables. By recursively applying the technique proposed here, we can treat the general case of multi-level systems.},

  abstract = {Compatibility equations of elasticity are almost 150 years old.
Interestingly they do not seem to have been rigorously studied for non-
simply-connected bodies to this date. In this paper we derive necessary and
sufficient compatibility equations of nonlinear elasticity for arbitrary non-
simply-connected bodies when the ambient space is Euclidean. For a non-
simply-connected body, a measure of strain may not be compatible even if
the standard compatibility equations (âbulkâ compatibility equations) are
satisfied. It turns out that there may be topological obstructions to compati-
bility and this paper aims to understand them for both deformation gradient
F and the right Cauchy-Green strain $C = F^T F$. We show that the neces-
sary and sufficient conditions for compatibility of deformation gradient F are
vanishing of its exterior derivative and all its periods, i.e. its integral over
generators of the first homology group of the material manifold. We will show
that not every non-null-homotopic path requires supplementary compatibil-
ity equations for F and linearized strain e. We then find both necessary and
sufficient compatibility conditions for the right Cauchy-Green strain tensor
C for arbitrary non-simply-connected bodies when the material and ambient
space manifolds have the same dimensions. We discuss the well-known neces-
sary compatibility equations in the linearized setting and the Cesaro-Volterra
a path integral. We then obtain the sufficient conditions of compatibility for
the linearized strain when the body is not simply-connected.
To summarize, the question of compatibility reduces to two issues: i) an
integrability condition, which is d(FdX) = 0 for deformation gradient and a
curvature vanishing condition for C, and ii) a topological condition. For FdX
this is a homological condition because the equation one is trying to solve
takes the form dÏ = FdX. For C, however, parallel transport is involved,
which means that one needs to solve an equation of the form dR = RK,
where R takes values in the orthogonal group. This is, therefore, a question
about an orthogonal representation of the fundamental group, which, as the
orthogonal group is not commutative, cannot, in general, be reduced to a
homological question.},
  comment  = {Compatibility equations in elasticity have an old history. Given a measure
of strain, compatibility equations are the necessary and sufficient conditions
that guarantee existence of a deformation mapping or a single-valued dis-
placement field. In the language of differential geometry this is closely related
to existence of an isometry between two Riemannian manifolds. When one
manifold is Euclidean, Riemann showed that locally an isometry exists if and
only if the Riemann curvature tensor vanishes.},

  Abstract                 = {The ensemble Kalman filter provides an easy-to-use, flexible, and efficient option for data assimilation
problems. One of its attractive features in land surface applications is its ability to provide distributional
information about variables, such as soil moisture, that can be highly skewed or even bimodal. The en-
semble Kalman filter relies on normality approximations that improve its efficiency but can also compro-
mise the accuracy of its distributional estimates. The effects of these approximations can be evaluated by
comparing the conditional marginal distributions and moments estimated by the ensemble Kalman filter
with those obtained from a sequential importance resampling (SIR) particle filter, which gives exact solu-
tions for large ensemble sizes. Comparisons for two land surface examples indicate that the ensemble
Kalman filter is generally able to reproduce nonnormal soil moisture behavior, including the skewness that
occurs when the soil is either very wet or very dry. Its conditional mean estimates are very close to those
generated by the SIR filter. Its higher-order conditional moments are somewhat less accurate than the
means. Overall, the ensemble Kalman filter appears to provide a good approximation for nonlinear, non-
normal land surface problems, despite its dependence on normality assumptions.},

  Abstract                 = {A methodology for model error estimation is proposed and examined in this study. It provides estimates
of the dynamical model state, the bias, and the empirical parameters by combining three approaches: 1)
ensemble data assimilation, 2) state augmentation, and 3) parameter and model bias estimation. Uncer-
tainties of these estimates are also determined, in terms of the analysis and forecast error covariances,
employing the same methodology.
The model error estimation approach is evaluated in application to Kortewegâde VriesâBurgers (KdVB)
numerical model within the framework of maximum likelihood ensemble filter (MLEF). Experimental
results indicate improved filter performance due to model error estimation. The innovation statistics also
indicate that the estimated uncertainties are reliable. On the other hand, neglecting model errors--either in
the form of an incorrect model parameter, or a model bias--has detrimental effects on data assimilation, in
some cases resulting in filter divergence.
Although the method is examined in a simplified model framework, the results are encouraging. It
remains to be seen how the methodology performs in applications to more complex models.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract A new ensemble-based data assimilation method, named the maximum likelihood ensemble filter (MLEF), is presented. The analysis solution maximizes the likelihood of the posterior probability distribution, obtained by minimization of a cost function that depends on a general nonlinear observation operator. The MLEF belongs to the class of deterministic ensemble filters, since no perturbed observations are employed. As in variational and ensemble data assimilation methods, the cost function is derived using a Gaussian probability density function framework. Like other ensemble data assimilation algorithms, the MLEF produces an estimate of the analysis uncertainty (e.g., analysis error covariance). In addition to the common use of ensembles in calculation of the forecast error covariance, the ensembles in MLEF are exploited to efficiently calculate the Hessian preconditioning and the gradient of the cost function.

The MLEF method is well suited for use with highly nonlinear observation operators, for a small additional computational cost of minimization. The consistent treatment of nonlinear observation operators through optimization is an advantage of the MLEF over other ensemble data assimilation algorithms. The cost of MLEF is comparable to the cost of existing ensemble Kalman filter algorithms. The method is directly applicable to most complex forecast models and observation operators. In this paper, the MLEF method is applied to data assimilation with the one-dimensional Korteweg?de Vries?Burgers equation. The tested observation operator is quadratic, in order to make the assimilation problem more challenging. The results illustrate the stability of the MLEF performance, as well as the benefit of the cost function minimization.

  abstract    = {Partial differential equations (PDEs) are commonly derived based on empirical observations. However, recent advances of technology enable us to collect and store massive amount of data, which offers new opportunities for data-driven discovery of PDEs. In this paper, we propose a new deep neural network, called PDE-Net 2.0, to discover (time-dependent) PDEs from observed dynamic data with minor prior knowledge on the underlying mechanism that drives the dynamics. The design of PDE-Net 2.0 is based on our earlier work \cite{Long2018PDE} where the original version of PDE-Net was proposed. PDE-Net 2.0 is a combination of numerical approximation of differential operators by convolutions and a symbolic multi-layer neural network for model recovery. Comparing with existing approaches, PDE-Net 2.0 has the most flexibility and expressive power by learning both differential operators and the nonlinear response function of the underlying PDE model. Numerical experiments show that the PDE-Net 2.0 has the potential to uncover the hidden PDE of the observed dynamics, and predict the dynamical behavior for a relatively long time, even in a noisy environment.},

  year        = {2018},
  abstract    = {Recent work linking deep neural networks and dynamical systems opened up new avenues to analyze deep learning. In particular, it is observed that new insights can be obtained by recasting deep learning as an optimal control problem on difference or differential equations. However, the mathematical aspects of such a formulation have not been systematically explored. This paper introduces the mathematical formulation of the population risk minimization problem in deep learning as a mean-field optimal control problem. Mirroring the development of classical optimal control, we state and prove optimality conditions of both the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman type and the Pontryagin type. These mean-field results reflect the probabilistic nature of the learning problem. In addition, by appealing to the mean-field Pontryagin's maximum principle, we establish some quantitative relationships between population and empirical learning problems. This serves to establish a mathematical foundation for investigating the algorithmic and theoretical connections between optimal control and deep learning.},

In this work, we investigate neural networks (NN) as physically-sound data-driven representations of such systems. Reinterpreting Runge-Kutta methods as graphical models, we consider a residual NN architecture and introduce bilinear layers to embed non-linearities which are intrinsic features of dynamical systems. From numerical experiments for classic dynamical systems, we demonstrate the relevance of the proposed NN-based architecture both in terms of forecasting performance and model identification.},

We show how to extend the class of learnable equations for a recently proposed equation learning network to include divisions, and we improve the learning and model selection strategy to be useful for challenging real-world data. For systems governed by analytical expressions, our method can in many cases identify the true underlying equation and extrapolate to unseen domains. We demonstrate its effectiveness by experiments on a cart-pendulum system, where only 2 random rollouts are required to learn the forward dynamics and successfully achieve the swing-up task.},

In the natural sciences, however, finding an interpretable function for a phenomenon is the prime goal as it allows to understand and generalize results. This paper proposes a novel type of function learning network, called equation learner (EQL), that can learn analytical expressions and is able to extrapolate to unseen domains. It is implemented as an end-to-end differentiable feed-forward network and allows for efficient gradient based training. Due to sparsity regularization concise interpretable expressions can be obtained. Often the true underlying source expression is identified.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

  year        = {2018},
  abstract    = {Partial differential equations (PDEs) are indispensable for modeling many physical phenomena and also commonly used for solving image processing tasks. In the latter area, PDE-based approaches interpret image data as discretizations of multivariate functions and the output of image processing algorithms as solutions to certain PDEs. Posing image processing problems in the infinite dimensional setting provides powerful tools for their analysis and solution. Over the last few decades, the reinterpretation of classical image processing problems through the PDE lens has been creating multiple celebrated approaches that benefit a vast area of tasks including image segmentation, denoising, registration, and reconstruction. In this paper, we establish a new PDE-interpretation of a class of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) that are commonly used to learn from speech, image, and video data. Our interpretation includes convolution residual neural networks (ResNet), which are among the most promising approaches for tasks such as image classification having improved the state-of-the-art performance in prestigious benchmark challenges. Despite their recent successes, deep ResNets still face some critical challenges associated with their design, immense computational costs and memory requirements, and lack of understanding of their reasoning. Guided by well-established PDE theory, we derive three new ResNet architectures that fall into two new classes: parabolic and hyperbolic CNNs. We demonstrate how PDE theory can provide new insights and algorithms for deep learning and demonstrate the competitiveness of three new CNN architectures using numerical experiments.},

  title       = {Beyond Finite Layer Neural Networks: Bridging Deep Architectures and Numerical Differential Equations},
  abstract    = {In our work, we bridge deep neural network design with numerical differential equations. We show that many effective networks, such as ResNet, PolyNet, FractalNet and RevNet, can be interpreted as different numerical discretizations of differential equations. This finding brings us a brand new perspective on the design of effective deep architectures. We can take advantage of the rich knowledge in numerical analysis to guide us in designing new and potentially more effective deep networks. As an example, we propose a linear multi-step architecture (LM-architecture) which is inspired by the linear multi-step method solving ordinary differential equations. The LM-architecture is an effective structure that can be used on any ResNet-like networks. In particular, we demonstrate that LM-ResNet and LM-ResNeXt (i.e. the networks obtained by applying the LM-architecture on ResNet and ResNeXt respectively) can achieve noticeably higher accuracy than ResNet and ResNeXt on both CIFAR and ImageNet with comparable numbers of trainable parameters. In particular, on both CIFAR and ImageNet, LM-ResNet/LM-ResNeXt can significantly compress ($>50$\%) the original networks while maintaining a similar performance. This can be explained mathematically using the concept of modified equation from numerical analysis. Last but not least, we also establish a connection between stochastic control and noise injection in the training process which helps to improve generalization of the networks. Furthermore, by relating stochastic training strategy with stochastic dynamic system, we can easily apply stochastic training to the networks with the LM-architecture. As an example, we introduced stochastic depth to LM-ResNet and achieve significant improvement over the original LM-ResNet on CIFAR10.},

  title        = {Automatic differentiation in machine learning: a survey},
  abstract     = {Derivatives, mostly in the form of gradients and Hessians, are ubiquitous in machine learning. Automatic differentiation (AD), also called algorithmic differentiation or simply "autodiff", is a family of techniques similar to but more general than backpropagation for efficiently and accurately evaluating derivatives of numeric functions expressed as computer programs. AD is a small but established field with applications in areas including computational fluid dynamics, atmospheric sciences, and engineering design optimization. Until very recently, the fields of machine learning and AD have largely been unaware of each other and, in some cases, have independently discovered each other's results. Despite its relevance, general-purpose AD has been missing from the machine learning toolbox, a situation slowly changing with its ongoing adoption under the names "dynamic computational graphs" and "differentiable programming". We survey the intersection of AD and machine learning, cover applications where AD has direct relevance, and address the main implementation techniques. By precisely defining the main differentiation techniques and their interrelationships, we aim to bring clarity to the usage of the terms "autodiff", "automatic differentiation", and "symbolic differentiation" as these are encountered more and more in machine learning settings.},
